## 1 General guidance

## 1.1 Scope

- 1.1.1 This guidance document relates to Section II of the 2023 risk-based supervision data collection which requires the provision of activity-based data from Reporting Entities registered to carry on virtual asset service provider ( VASP ) activity.
- 1.1.2 Virtual asset service provider, as defined in the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 ( POCL ), includes a natural or legal person or arrangement that carries on the business of conducting one or more of the following activities or operations to, for or on behalf of another natural or legal person or arrangement:
- (a) Exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies,
- (b) Exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets,
- (c) Transfer of virtual assets,
- (d) Safekeeping or administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control over virtual assets,
- (e) Participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer's offer and/or sale of a virtual asset.
- 1.1.3 The Excel workbook for a reporting entity carrying on VASP comprises 5 spreadsheet pages, as follows:
- (a)
- VCA-VASP - Compliance Data
- (b)
- VCB-VASP - Customer Data
- (c) VCC-VASP - Beneficial Ownership
- (d) VCD-VASP - Use and application of concessions granted by the MLO i
- (e) VCE-VASP - Country List
- 1.1.4 Spreadsheet VCE-VASP is an input sheet for the responses to questions VCB12, VCB13 and VCC1.

## 1.2 Customers

- 1.2.1 The spreadsheets require VASPs to provide data in respect of their customers.
- 1.2.2 A customer is a person to whom the VASP provides any of the services as described in 1.1.2 above.

## 1.3 Data reporting period

- 1.3.1 Generally, data should be provided for the period 01/01/2023 to 31/12/2023.
- 1.3.2 There are a few data items where the data should be provided as at the end of the reporting period (31/12/2023 or closest business day).

## 1.4 Data Submission

- 1.4.1 Each VASP will be submitting a completed Excel Workbook for Section II through the JFSC Portal, and each VASP has a designated individual who is the JFSC Portal contact, which, in the vast majority of cases, is the money laundering compliance officer.

- 1.4.2 Notwithstanding that the JFSC Portal contact has responsibility for submitting the data, the board, or equivalent, of the VASP should have oversight of the content of any submission made on their behalf.
- 1.4.3 Please be advised that the JFSC will request similar information from the Reporting Entity periodically throughout the course of its registration with the JFSC. It is therefore recommended that the Reporting Entity implements reporting processes for this type of information.
- 1.4.4 Where a VASP needs to extrapolate or estimate its data, the comments section at the bottom of the relevant spreadsheet should highlight which data elements have been impacted, the extent they have been impacted and when the relevant system changes will take effect.
- 1.4.5 Where the VASP feels it necessary to provide additional data to enable the JFSC to understand the response, this information should also be included in the comments section at the bottom of each relevant spreadsheet.
- 1.4.6 With the exception of spreadsheet VCE-VASP-Country list , all parts of each question should be answered. Consequently, please insert a '0' where relevant.

## 1.5 Integrity checking your submission

- 1.5.1 Before submitting your data, the JFSC suggests that the integrity checks highlighted in paragraphs 1.5.2 to 1.5.5.
- 1.5.2 Sum of VCA1(a) to (c) needs to agree to the sum of VCB1(i) to (iii).
- 1.5.3 VCA1(a) should equal sum of VCB5(i) to (iii).
- 1.5.4 No response in VCB2 should exceed VCB1, in any given column.
- 1.5.5 VCB6 and VCB7 cannot be individually greater than VCB2, in any column.

## 2 Section VC -VASP Compliance Data

## 2.1 Overview

- 2.1.1 This section collects data on:
- (a) customer risk ratings;
- (b) business which has been declined, terminated, or withdrawn due to customer due diligence or other financial crime concerns; and
- (c) transaction monitoring.

## 2.2 Risk Rating

- VCA1 Number of customers in each category of risk (as defined by the VASP) during the data reporting period

(a) Higher; (b) Standard; (c) Lower

- VCA2 Does the VASP's risk ratings as specified above include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism? (Yes ; No) If yes, please provide details at VCA12(a)
- 2.2.1 Question VCA1 requests data about the number of customers that have been assessed as presenting (a) higher, (b) standard or (c) lower ML/TF risk (on the basis of factors set out in section 3.3.4 of the Handbook for the prevention and detection of money laundering, the countering of terrorist financing, and the countering of proliferation financing (the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook )).
- 2.2.2 Where use is made of a more precise risk scoring scale, it will be necessary to determine which categories in that scale approximate to higher ii , standard or lower risk. For example, if a VASP measures risk on a score of 1 to 10, it may consider anything between 1 and 3 to present a lower risk, 4 to 7 to present a standard risk, and 8 to 10 to present a higher risk.
- 2.2.3 If a VASP includes other factors e.g., commercial risk, in its risk rating of customers and the ML/TF risk element cannot be reported separately, please report the combined risk rating.
- 2.2.4 If a combined rating is reported, please select 'yes' when responding to VCA2 .
- 2.2.5 Please provide an answer for every element of VCA1. For example, a VASP with zero higher risk, 4 medium risk and 6 lower risk customers and who only considers money laundering and terrorist financing when risk rating a customer, should complete the fields as follows:

- 3.2.1 Question VCB1 requests the total number of customers as at 31 December 2023 analysed by customer type as listed in Error! Reference source not found. and Error! Reference source not found. .
- 3.2.2 Please note that the response provided to question VCB1 provides the base for responding to all other Section VCB questions.
- 3.2.3 For example, given a response to question VCB1 as set out in the table below then the number of customers is the maximum number that can appear in the relevant column for other Section VCB questions:
- 3.2.4 Where a VASP has no customers of a particular type please insert '0'.
- 3.2.5 Please note the sum of VCB1(i) to (iii) should equal the sum of VCA1(a) to (c).

| Customer type                     |   Number of  customers |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Individuals - Jersey resident     |                     10 |
| Individuals - non-Jersey resident |                      2 |
| Other                             |                      1 |

## VCB2  Number of active customers

- 3.2.6 Question VCB2 requests the number of customers as at 31 December 2023 that were active.
- 3.2.7 For example, an active customer may be defined as a customer that has utilised the services of the VASP within the 12-month period.

## VCB3  Number of customers that are considered dormant (as defined by the VASP)

- 3.2.8 Question VCB3 requests the number of customers as at 31 December 2023 that were considered to be inactive or dormant.
- 3.2.9 For example, a dormant customer may be defined as a customer that has not utilised the services of the VASP within the 12-month period, and/or has ceased interactions with the business.

## 3.3 Enhanced CDD measures

- 3.3.1 Information regarding enhanced CDD measures can be found in Section 7 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook.
- 3.3.2 In addition to a VASP deciding that a customer presents a higher risk of ML/TF/PF, there are some circumstances where enhanced CDD measures are required by Articles 15, 15A and 15B of the Money Laundering Order. Such as where the customer:
- (a) is, or some other prescribed person is, a politically exposed person ( PEP ) (section 7.6)
- (b) has a 'relevant connection' to an 'enhanced risk state' (section 7.5)
- (c) is a company with nominee shareholders or issues bearer shares (section 7.10)
- (d) is a personal asset holding vehicle (section 7.9)
- (e) is, or some other person is, not physically present for identification purpose (section 7.4)
- (f) is non-resident (not a Jersey resident) (section 7.7)
- (g) has a correspondent banking or similar relationship (Section 7.11)
- 3.3.3 Under Article 15(1)(a) of the Money Laundering Order, if a customer has, or proposes to have a business relationship or proposes to carry out a one-off transaction with the VASP, and the VASP is not resident in the customer's country of residence or in the same country as the country from which, or from within which, the customer is carrying on business, a VASP must apply enhanced customer due diligence measures on a risk-sensitive basis.

## VCB4 Number where enhanced CDD measures have been applied: (i) Individuals - Jersey resident; (ii) Individuals - non-Jersey resident; (iii) other

- 3.3.4 Using the response to question VCB1 as the base for responding, question VCB4 requires data about the number of customers to which enhanced CDD measures have been applied during 2023.
- 3.3.5 For example, using the example laid out in Error! Reference source not found. , if 3 of the 10 customers that are reported as 'individuals - Jersey' have been subject to enhanced CDD measures then respond '3'.
- 3.3.6 If a VASP has no customers which have been subject to enhanced CDD measures, then insert '0' in each blue box.

## VCB5

## Number that present higher risk of ML/TF/PF: (i) Individuals - Jersey resident; (ii) Individuals - non-Jersey resident; (iii) Other

- 3.3.7 Where a VASP has determined that a customer presents a higher risk of ML/TF/PF, enhanced CDD measures must be applied, therefore the response to question VCB5 should not be greater than the response to question VCB4.
- 3.3.8 There are circumstances where enhanced CDD measures must be applied but the VASP may not consider the customer presents a higher risk, therefore the response to VCB5 may be lower than the response to VCB4. For example, a Jersey resident owns an asset holding vehicle which holds bank balances.
- 3.3.9 Enhanced due diligence data in your workbooks should be provided in line with the requirements of the Money Laundering Order . If enhanced due diligence is undertaken as standard on non-Jersey customers, then all customers where standard CDD checks are applied should be reported as having been subject to enhanced due diligence. The data needs to accurately reflect the application of enhanced due diligence as defined in the Money Laundering Order. If there is a significant difference between the number of customers who have enhanced due diligence applied to them and the number of non-Jersey-based customers, then please be ready to explain the difference in VCB19.
- 3.3.10 If a VASP has no customers which present a higher risk please do not leave a cell blank, please insert '0' in each blue box.
- 3.3.11 The total of this row should be the same as the answer to question VCA1(a).

## VCB6 Number who are, or who are connected to, a PEP:

(i) Individuals - Jersey resident; (ii) Individuals - non-Jersey resident; (iii) Other

- 3.3.12 Using the response to question VCB1 as the base for responding, question VCB6 requires the number of customers to which enhanced CDD measures have been applied due to a PEP connection.
- 3.3.13 On 12 June 2019 the Money Laundering Order was amended (see Article 15A of the Money Laundering Order and Section 7.6.1 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook). From this date, enhanced CDD measures became mandatory for the following:
- (a) a domestic politically exposed person only where a high-risk business relationships or high-risk one-off transactions is involved ( domestic PEP );
- (b) a foreign politically exposed person ( foreign PEP );
- (c) a prominent person;
- (d) individuals falling within (a), (b) or (c) that are:
- › beneficial owners or controllers of a customer entity;
- › a third party for whom the customer entity acts AND the third parties beneficial owners or controllers;
- › purporting to act on behalf of the customer entity.
- 3.3.14 When considering whether a customer is connected with a domestic PEP or foreign PEP it must be remembered that the definition of a PEP includes close associates and immediate family members of any individual. Close associate and immediate family member are both defined in Article 15A(3) of the Money Laundering Order.
- 3.3.15 The information to be considered when deciding if a person is a close associate of a domestic PEP or foreign PEP is limited to information in the possession of the VASP

or information that is publicly known (Article 15A(4) of the Money Laundering Order).

- 3.3.16 If a VASP has no customers who are a PEP, or who are connected with a PEP, please do not leave a cell blank, please insert '0' in each blue box.

## Number that have a relevant connection to an enhanced risk state: (i) Individuals - Jersey resident; (ii) Individuals - non-Jersey resident; (iii) Other

- 3.3.17 Using the response to question VCB1 as the base for responding, question VCB7 requires the number of customers to which enhanced CDD measures have been applied because the customer has a connection to an enhanced risk state.
- 3.3.18 Appendix D1 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook provides a list of the countries and territories that are considered an enhanced risk state. As at 31 December 2023 the following were listed:
- (a) Iran;
- (b) The Democratic People's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ); and
- (c) Myanmar (Burma)
- 3.3.19 Section 7.5 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook provides further guidance, including an example of what may constitute a relevant connection.
- 3.3.20 For example: a customer's source of funds is, or derives from:
- (a) assets held in either Iran, DPRK or Myanmar by the customer or any person on behalf of a customer; or
- (b) income arising in Iran, DPRK or Myanmar.
- 3.3.21 In either scenario the VASP should take reasonable measures to find out the source of wealth of the customer.
- 3.3.22 If a VASP has no customers with a relevant connection to an enhanced risk state, please do not leave a cell blank, please insert '0' in each blue box.

## 4 Section VCC - Beneficial ownership

## 4.1 General

- 4.1.1 Where the CDD exemptions from applying identification measures under Article 18 of the Money Laundering Order have been utilised and no data is held, a VASP is not expected to gather information for the purpose of completing questions VCC1.

## 4.2 Customers who are individuals and beneficial owners or controllers of customers that are not individuals

- VCC1 Number and principal country of residence of: (i) individuals who are customers; and (ii) individuals who are the beneficial owner or controller of a customer that is not an individual, as at the reporting date
- 4.2.1 The principal country of residence of an individual who is a customer, or the beneficial owners and controllers of customers who are not individuals, is recognised as a key factor in determining the riskiness of a customer - section 3 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook provides further guidance.
- 4.2.2 The term 'beneficial ownership and control' is defined in Article 2 of the Money Laundering Order. It refers to the individuals who ultimately own or control a customer that is a legal person iii . In line with guidance provided in the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook, the following will be considered to be the beneficial owner or controller of a company.
- (a) Each individual with a material controlling ownership interest in the capital of the company (through direct or indirect holdings of interests (shares) or voting rights) or who exerts control through other ownership means.
- (b) To the extent that there is doubt as to whether the individuals exercising control through ownership are beneficial owners, or where no individual exerts control through ownership, any other individual exercising control of the company through other means.
- (c) Where no individual is otherwise identified, individuals who exercise control of the company through positions held (who have and exercise strategic decisiontaking powers or have and exercise executive control through senior management positions - directors).
- 4.2.3 Question VCC1 requests a VASP provide by country (using spreadsheet VCE-VASPCountry list ) the total number of customers who are individuals and beneficial owners or controllers of customers that are not individuals, as at the reporting date.
- 4.2.4 Unlike other questions, there is no need to insert a response in each cell of spreadsheet VCE-VASP-Country list .
- 4.2.5 For example, using the data at Error! Reference source not found. , the data may look as follows:

| Customer type                 |   Number of customers | Principal country of  residence   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Individuals - Jersey resident |                    10 | Jersey                            |
| Customer type                     | Number of customers   | Principal country of  residence   |
| Individuals - non-Jersey resident | 2                     | UK                                |
|                                   |                       | Guernsey                          |
| Other                             | 1                     | Switzerland                       |

Spreadsheet VCE-VASP-Country list would therefore have the following entries in the column for question VCC1:

| ISO  Code   | Country     | Number and principal country of residence of:  (i) individuals who are customers; and  (ii) individuals who are the beneficial owners or controllers of  a customer that is not an individual   |
