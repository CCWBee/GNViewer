## 1 General guidance

## 1.1 Overview

- 1.1.1 In 2018 the JFSC collected supervisory risk data from reporting entities for the first time. This exercise was repeated in 2019 and 2020. As advised on 24 November 2020 i , the JFSC is collecting the same data in 2021 with respect to 2020.
- 1.1.2 This guidance document relates to Section II of the 2021 risk based supervision data collection which requires the provision of activity based data from Reporting Entities registered to carry on deposit-taking business and this document provides guidance to deposit-takers in respect of the data collection process.
- 1.1.3 It should be noted that the JFSC is collecting data from deposit-takers in respect of both their deposit-taking and lending activities. This is on the basis that lending is an integral part of the definition of deposit-taking and is itself a Schedule 2 activity.
- 1.1.4 Sections 2 to 9 of this document contain the data requests and provide additional information in respect of each element.
- 1.1.5 As the JFSC is collecting data separately about deposit-taking activity and lending activity, and this document covers each spreadsheet, there is a degree of repetition in the guidance. However, deposit-takers are urged to read all elements of the guidance as the data requests for deposit-taking activity and lending activity are not identical.
- 1.1.6 As some customers may be both deposit-taking and lending customers there may be a degree of 'double counting' but it is important that deposit-takers provide their data split between deposit-taking and lending as this highlights any significant differences in customer profiles. For example, a deposit-taker may record the majority of its deposit-taking customers as individuals (Jersey and non-Jersey) and Jersey companies but its lending customers may be mainly Non-Jersey companies.

## 1.2 Scope

- 1.2.1 Deposit-taking business is a financial services business activity as set out in Schedule 2 to the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 ( Schedule 2 ), specifically paragraph 1 of Part A of Schedule 2. Deposit-taking business is defined in Article 3 of the Banking Business (Jersey) Law 1991 ( BB(J)L ) as follows:
- (1) In this Law, unless the context otherwise requires, a person carries on a deposit-taking business if -
- (a) in the course of that business the person lends the whole or any part of a deposit received by that person to any other person; or
- (b) the person uses the whole or any part of any deposit received by him or her in the course of that business, or the whole or any part of any interest derived from a deposit received by him or her in the course of that business, to finance to a material extent any other activity of the business.
- 1.2.2 If a person is registered to carry on deposit-taking business but does not undertake any form of lending i.e. the person is registered by virtue of part (b) of the deposittaking definition (see 1.2.1), then the lending spreadsheets are not applicable.

## 1.3 Excel workbook

Guide to Section II of risk based supervision data: Deposit-taking Business

## 1.3.1 The Excel workbook for a Reporting Entity carrying on deposit-taking business comprises 10 spreadsheets, as follows:

## Compliance data

H - Deposit-taking compliance data

HA - Lending compliance data

## Customer data

J - Deposit-taking customer data

JA - Lending customer data

## Beneficial ownership data

K - Deposit-taking beneficial ownership

KA - Lending beneficial ownership

## Use and application of Money Laundering Order concessions

L - Deposit-taking use and application of concessions granted by the MLO ii

LA - Lending use and application of concessions granted by the MLO 1

## Country-based information

M - Deposit-taking country list

MA - Lending country list

- 1.3.2 Spreadsheet M is an input sheet for the responses to questions H9, H12, K1, K2, L4, L5, and L9(c).
- 1.3.3 Spreadsheet MA is an input sheet for the responses to questions HA9, KA1, KA2, LA4, LA5 and LA9(c).

## 1.4 Customers

- 1.4.1 A deposit-taking business is required to complete the spreadsheets in respect of their customers.
- 1.4.2 For the purpose of completing the spreadsheets customers must be identified as:
- (a) Deposit-taking customers - a person from whom the deposit-taker has received a deposit, and
- (b) Lending customers - a person to whom a loan has been made.

## 1.5 Data reporting period

- 1.5.1 Generally, data should be provided for the period 1/1/2020 to 31/12/2020.
- 1.5.2 There are a few data items where the data should be provided as at the end of the reporting period (31/12/2020 or closest business day).

## 1.6 Data submission

- 1.6.1 Whilst the JFSC will be collecting the same data as it did in previous years, deposittaking businesses are still recommended to consider the data request as soon as possible. It may take some time to gather the data requested and the deadline for submission is 17:00 on 31 March 2021 .
- 1.6.2 Each deposit-taking business will be submitting a completed Excel Workbook for Section II through the JFSC Portal, and each deposit-taking business has a

designated individual who is the JFSC Portal contact, which, in the vast majority of cases, is the compliance officer.

- 1.6.3 Notwithstanding that the JFSC Portal contact has responsibility for submitting the data, the board, or equivalent in a branch scenario (Principal Manager), of the deposit-taking business should have oversight of the content of the submission made on their behalf.
- 1.6.1 Having completed the data return in 2018, 2019 and 2020 the JFSC expects deposittaking businesses to be in a good position to report their 2020 data and that only on a very exceptional basis will responses need to be derived by extrapolation or estimates supported by specific criteria.
- 1.6.2 The JFSC continues to acknowledge that system changes take time to implement. Where a deposit-taking business needs to extrapolate or estimate its data as system changes are still being implemented, the comments section at the bottom of the relevant spreadsheet should highlight which data elements have been extrapolated/estimated and when the relevant system changes will take effect. Where a deposit-taking business needs to extrapolate or estimate its data, as system changes are still being implemented, or where it is felt necessary to provide additional data to enable the JFSC to understand the response, please provide this information to your supervision manager/supervision team by 28 February 2021.
- 1.6.3 Where the deposit- taking business feels it necessary to provide additional data to enable the JFSC to understand the response, this information should also be included in the comments section at the bottom of each relevant spreadsheet.
- 1.6.4 A deposit-taking business should complete all parts of each question on the relevant spreadsheets, with the exception of spreadsheets M-DC Country list and MA-DC Lending Country list where it is not necessary to insert a '0' against each country.

## 1.7 Integrity checking your submission

- 1.7.1 Before submitting your data the JFSC suggests that the integrity checks highlighted in paragraphs 1.7.2 to 1.7.3(g) should be completed.
- 1.7.2 Deposit-taking

## 2 Section H - Deposit-taking compliance data

## 2.1 Overview

- 2.1.1 This section collects data on:
- (a) deposit-taking customer risk ratings;
- (b) deposit-taking business which has been declined, terminated or withdrawn due to customer due diligence or other financial crime concerns;
- (c) referred business (the extent to which deposit-taking customers are obtained on the basis of referrals from other businesses);
- (d) correspondent banking; and
- (e) deposit-taking transaction monitoring.
- 2.1.2 Please note this section should be completed for deposit-taking customers. Any customer whose accounts are overdrawn (permanently or temporarily) should be included in this section.

## 2.2 Deposit-taking risk rating

- H1 Number of deposit-taking customers in each category of risk (as defined by the deposittaker) as at the end of the data reporting period
- (a) Higher
- (b) Standard
- (c) Lower
- (d) Very low
- H2 Do the deposit-taker's risk ratings include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism?
- (Yes ; No) If Yes, please provide details at H16(a)
- 2.2.1 Question H1(a) to (c) requests data about the number of deposit-taking customers that have been assessed as presenting (a) higher, (b) standard, or (c) lower ML/TF risk (on the basis of factors set out in Section 3.3.4 of the AML/CFT Handbook).
- 2.2.2 Question H1(d ) also requests data about the number of deposit-taking customers that have been assessed as presenting a very low ML/TF risk (Section 7.17 of the AML/CFT Handbook).
- 2.2.3 Section 7.17 of the AML/CFT Handbook notes that where funds involved in a relationship:
- (a) have been received from a bank that is a regulated person or carries on equivalent business to deposit taking; and
- (b) have come from an account in the sole or joint name of the customer who is an individual (or are individuals),

then the receipt of funds from such an account may be considered to be reasonably capable of verifying that the person to be identified is who the person is said to be where the product or service requested by the customer is considered to present a very low money laundering or financing of terrorism risk.

- 2.2.4 The product or service must meet certain conditions in order to benefit from this concession (as set out at paragraph 136 of Section 7.17 of the AML/CFT Handbook).

- 2.2.5 Where use is made of a more precise risk scoring scale, it will be necessary to determine which categories in that scale approximate to higher iii , standard or lower risk. For example, if a deposit-taking business measures risk on a score of 1 to 10, it may consider anything between 1 and 3 to present a lower risk, 4 to 7 to present a standard risk, and 8 to 10 to present a higher risk.
- 2.2.6 If a deposit-taking business includes other factors e.g. credit risk, in its risk rating of customers and the ML/TF risk element cannot be reported separately, please report the combined risk rating.
- 2.2.7 If a combined rating is reported please select 'yes' when responding to H2 and provide details at H16(a) (free text box) of the other factors included.
- 2.2.8 Please do not leave fields blank, insert a '0' in H1(a), H1(b), H1(c) H1(d) if no deposit-taking customers are rated as higher, standard, lower or very low respectively.
- 2.2.9 Please note the sum of H1(a) to (d) should equal the sum of J1a(i) to (viii).
- H3 If the deposit-taker risk rates any beneficial owners/controllers of deposit-taking customers, or other persons who must be identified under Article 3 of the MLO, the number in each category of risk (as defined by the deposit-taker) as at the end of the data reporting period
- H4 With respect to H3, do the deposit-taker's risk ratings include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism? (Yes ; No ; N/A) If Yes, please provide details at H16(b)
- 2.2.10 It is not a requirement of the MLO or AML/CFT Handbook for a deposit-taking business to risk rate the beneficial owners and controllers of their customers, including any person purporting to act on behalf of the customer. However, the JFSC would like to understand the extent to which this happens in practice.
- 2.2.11 If a deposit-taking business does risk rate any beneficial owners and controllers of their deposit-taking customers, question H3 and H4 should be answered. The guidance in 2.2.5 to 2.2.7 should be followed where appropriate.
- 2.2.12 It is understood that a deposit-taker may risk rate some but not all beneficial owners and controllers of their deposit-taking customers, in this case please respond with respect to those that are risk rated.
- 2.2.13 If a deposit-taking business does not risk rate any beneficial owners and controllers of their deposit-taking customers, please insert a '0' in all cells H3(a)-(c) and select 'N/A' from the drop down menu at H4.

## 2.3 Declined, terminated and withdrawn deposit-taking business

- H5 Number of applications from prospective deposit-taking customers to either (i) establish a business relationship, or (ii) carry out a one-off transaction, declined due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns, during the data reporting period
- H6 Number of business relationships terminated, due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns, during the data reporting period
- 2.3.1 In line with Section 2.4.1 of the AML/CFT Handbook (paragraph 32), questions H5 and H6 request data about:
- (a) the number of prospective business relationships or one-off transactions that have been declined ( H5 ); and

- (a) business relationships that have been terminated due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns ( H6 ).

This will include cases where:

- › it has not been possible to complete identification measures (before or during a business relationship) under the Money Laundering Order, including establishing the source of funds;
- › the ML/TF risk has been assessed as being too high (and so outside the deposit-taker's risk appetite); and
- › there is suspicion of ML/TF.
- 2.3.2 This question applies also to cases where:
- (a) an application to form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction is handled by a third party, e.g. a lawyer or lender, and where there is no direct contact with the prospective deposit-taking customer; and
- (b) an application to form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction has not yet been formally submitted, e.g. where CDD is applied at the time that business is being solicited (where this data is recorded).
- 2.3.1 Please do not leave fields blank, insert a '0' in H5 and H6 if no prospective deposittaking customers have been declined or customers terminated.

## H7 Number of applications from prospective deposit-taking customers who have withdrawn due to CDD issues, during the data reporting period (where this data is collected)

- 2.3.2 Question H7 collects data on deposit-taking customer applications withdrawn solely or partly on the basis of CDD requested.
- 2.3.3 It is recognised that this data may not be recorded by a deposit-taker. If this is the case please respond with '0'. Do not leave the field blank.
- 2.3.4 This question also applies to cases where an application to form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction is handled by a third party, e.g. a lawyer or lender, and where there is no direct contact with the prospective deposittaking customer.

## 2.4 Referred business - deposit-taking

- 2.4.1 Questions H8, H9 and H10 request data about those persons who referred deposit-taking customers to a deposit-taker on a regular basis during the data reporting period.
- 2.4.2 Where business is referred to a deposit-taker but neither a one-off transaction nor customer relationship result this is not considered referred business for the purpose of responding to H8, H9 and H10.
- 2.4.3 Persons who refer deposit-taking customers to a deposit-taker may be third parties such as lawyers, accountants and trust company businesses.
- 2.4.4 Additionally, if a deposit-taker is part of a group, any referrals from group companies or other branches of the same company should be included here. For example, if a Jersey deposit-taker is part of a group/company that has a UK company/branch then referrals from the UK operation should be reported subject to 2.4.5.
- 2.4.5 The following should not be reported as persons who refer deposit-taking customers:

18 December 2020

- (a) a third party or group entity that acts as an obliged person (Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order) or a person in the same financial group where reliance has been placed (Article 16A of the Money Laundering Order) (data on these persons is collected through spreadsheets L (Use of MLO concessions)); or
- (b) a customer acting on behalf of one or more third parties (data on these persons is collected through spreadsheet K (3rd party and beneficial ownership)); or
- (c) a person who refers deposit-taking customers on a basis that cannot be considered regular. The meaning of regular will vary by deposit-taker and will depend on a number of factors such as the size of their current deposit-taking customer base and the amount of referred deposit-taking business.
- 2.4.6 Note: A person may be classified as having referred deposit-taking business even if a deposit-taker does not pay that person a fee for the referrals.

## H8 Number of persons who referred deposit-taking customers to the deposit-taker during the data reporting period, which carry on the following activities

- 2.4.7 Question H8 requires analysis of the number of persons (entities) between those that are:
- (a) Lawyers;
- (b) Accountants;
- (c) TCBs; and
- (d) Other, which includes any referrals from another group company that is not a trust company business.
- 2.4.8 Where a deposit-taker business responds that the majority of the persons that are referring deposit-taking customers fall in 'Other' (H8(d)) please provide further details at H16 (general comments on section H). This may include referrals from existing deposit-taking and lending customers.
- 2.4.9 If a deposit-taker considers that it does not have any persons that refer deposittaking customers then please insert '0' into each of H8(a), H8(b), H8(c) and H8(d).
- H9 Number of persons who referred deposit-taking customers to the deposit-taker during the data reporting period, analysed by country
- 2.4.10 Question H9 requires the number of persons who referred deposit-taking customers to be analysed by country, using spreadsheet M-DC Country List .
- 2.4.11 Please note:
- (a) the countries are listed on spreadsheet M alphabetically; and
- (b) only positive responses are required i.e. there is no need to insert '0' against every country.
- H10 Number of relationships with persons who referred deposit-taking customers to the deposit-taker during the data reporting period that were terminated due to CDD issues, or other financial crime concerns
- 2.4.12 Question H10 requires a deposit-taker to record the number of times, during the data reporting period, that a relationship between them and a person who referred deposit-taking customers has been terminated, by either party, because of a CDD issue or other financial crime concern.

For example, in a case where the person referring deposit-taking customers considers that CDD measures applied by the deposit-taker are impractical or excessive.

- 2.4.13 If no terminations have occurred, please insert a '0' in response to H10.

## 2.5 Correspondent banking

- Does the deposit-taker provide correspondent banking services as at the end of the data
- H11 reporting period? (Yes ; No)

## H12 If the answer to H11 is yes, please mark with an 'X' the countries where respondent banks are located

- 2.5.1 Question H11 asks deposit-takers to advise whether they provide correspondent banking services.
- 2.5.2 As defined in Section 7.11 of the AML/CFT Handbook, correspondent banking is a term given to the provision of services by one bank (the correspondent ) to another bank (the respondent ) for the benefit of the customers of the respondent. As a result, the correspondent bank indirectly makes its services available to the customers of the respondent business; in doing so, the correspondent potentially exposes itself to additional risk.
- 2.5.3 Question H12 requests a deposit-taker to provide (using spreadsheet M-DC Country list) each country where a respondent bank is located. Only positive responses are required i.e. there is no need to insert '0' against every country.

## 2.6 Deposit-taking transaction monitoring

- H13 What is the timing of the ongoing monitoring of transactions during a business relationship?

(Real-time ; Post-event ; Both)

H14

Are monitoring procedures automatic or manual?

(Automated ; Manual ; Both)

## H15 What rules are applied to the transaction monitoring procedures? (Generic ; Tailored ; Both)

- 2.6.1 Questions H13 , H14 and H15 ask about transaction monitoring procedures.
- 2.6.2 In line with paragraph 16 of Section 6.2.1 of the AML/CFT Handbook, where a relevant person's customer base is homogeneous, and where the products and services provided to customers result in uniform patterns of transactions or activity, it will be more straightforward to establish parameters to identify usual transactions and unusual activity. However, where each customer is unique, and where the product or service provided is bespoke, a relevant person will need to tailor monitoring systems to the nature of its business and facilitate the application of additional judgement and experience to the recognition of unusual transactions and activity.
- 2.6.3 Please answer each question.

## 2.7 General comments

## H16 Please provide any explanations or context comments below

- 2.7.1 A freetext box is provided at H16(c) to provide general comments, explanations or context comments in relation to the other responses in section H-Deposit-taking compliance data.
- 2.7.2 If a deposit-taker selects 'yes' when responding to H2 details of the other factors included in the combined risk rating should be provided at H16(a)here.
- 2.7.3 Where a deposit-taker business responds that the majority of the persons that are referring deposit-taking customers fall in 'Other' (H8(d)) please provide at H16(c) further details in respect of those persons reported as 'Other'. This may include referrals from existing deposit-taking and lending customers.

## 3 Section HA - Lending compliance data

## 3.1 Overview

- 3.1.1 This section collects data on:
- (a) lending customer risk ratings;
- (b) lending business which has been declined, terminated or withdrawn due to customer due diligence or other financial crime concerns;
- (c) referred business (the extent to which lending customers are obtained on the basis of referrals from other businesses); and
- (d) lending transaction monitoring.
- 3.1.2 Please note this section should be completed for customers that have been granted a loan (secured or unsecured). Any customer whose accounts are overdrawn (permanently or temporarily) should be included in the deposit-taking section.

## 3.2 Lending risk rating

- HA1 Number of lending customers in each category of risk (as defined by the deposit-taker) as at the end of the data reporting period
- (a) Higher
- (b) Standard
- (c) Lower
- (d) Very low

## HA2 Do the deposit-taker's risk ratings include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism?

(Yes ; No) If Yes, please provide details at HA11(a)

- 3.2.1 Question HA1(a) to (c) requests data about the number of lending customers that have been assessed as presenting (a) higher, (b) standard, or (c) lower ML/TF risk (on the basis of factors set out in Section 3.3.4 of the AML/CFT Handbook).
- 3.2.2 Question HA1(d) also requests data about the number of lending customers that have been assessed as presenting a very low ML/TF risk (Section 7.17 of the AML/CFT Handbook).
- 3.2.3 Section 7.17 of the AML/CFT Handbook notes that where funds involved in a relationship:
- (a) have been received from a bank that is a regulated person or carries on equivalent business to deposit taking; and

then the receipt of funds from such an account may be considered to be reasonably capable of verifying that the person to be identified is who the person is said to be where the product or service requested by the customer is considered to present a very low money laundering or financing of terrorism risk.

- 3.2.4 The product or service must meet certain conditions in order to benefit from this concession (as set out at paragraph 136 of Section 7.17 of the AML/CFT Handbook).
- 3.2.5 Where use is made of a more precise risk scoring scale, it will be necessary to determine which categories in that scale approximate to higher iv , standard or lower risk. For example, if a deposit-taking business measures risk on a score of 1 to 10, it

18 December 2020

may consider anything between 1 and 3 to present a lower risk, 4 to 7 to present a standard risk, and 8 to 10 to present a higher risk.

- 3.2.6 If a deposit-taking business includes other factors e.g. credit risk, in its risk rating of customers and the ML/TF risk element cannot be reported separately, please report the combined risk rating.

- HA4 Do the deposit-taker's risk ratings include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism?

(Yes ; No ; N/A) If Yes, please provide details at HA11(b)

- 3.2.10 It is not a requirement of the MLO or AML/CFT Handbook for a deposit-taking business to risk rate the beneficial owners and controllers of their lending customers. However, the JFSC would like to understand the extent to which this happens in practice.
- 3.2.11 If a deposit-taking business does risk rate any beneficial owners and controllers of their lending customers, question HA3 and HA4 should be answered. The guidance in 3.2.5 to 3.2.7 should be followed where appropriate.
- 3.2.12 It is understood that a deposit-taker may risk rate some but not all beneficial owners and controllers of their lending customers, in this case please respond with respect to those that are risk rated.

- › the ML/TF risk has been assessed as being too high (and so outside the deposit-taker's risk appetite); and
- › there is suspicion of ML/TF.
- 3.3.2 This question applies also to cases where:

## 6.3 Customer acting on behalf of a third party

## K2 Number and principal country of residence of third parties on whose behalf a deposittaking customer is acting

- 6.3.1 Question K2 collects data on the principal country of residence of third parties on whose behalf a deposit-taking customer acts.
- 6.3.2 For example, a legal arrangement cannot form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction itself. It is the trustee(s) of the trust or general partner(s) of the limited partnership who will enter into a business relationship or carry out the oneoff transaction with a deposit-taker on behalf of the legal arrangement and who will be considered to be the customer(s). In line with Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order, the trust or limited partnership will be considered to be the third party on whose behalf the trustee(s) or general partner(s) act(s).
- 6.3.3 In these cases the deposit-taker should have identified the persons for whom the customer (e.g. trustee or general partner) is acting in line with Article 3(2) of the Money Laundering Order and the guidance provided in Section 4 of the AML/CFT Handbook. For ease guidance has been provided below:
- (a) In a case where the third party is a legal person (e.g. a company), data should be provided on the individuals who are beneficial owner or controller of that legal person (Article 3(2)(b)(ii) of the Money Laundering Order).
- (b) In a case where a third party is a trust (other than a collective deposit-taking fund), data should be provided on:
- › the settlor x ;
- › the protector;
- › beneficiaries with a vested right;
- › other beneficiaries and persons who are the object of a power that have been identified as presenting a higher risk; and
- › any other person who exercises ultimate effective control over the trust (Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order).
- (c) In a case where a third party is a limited partnership (other than a collective deposit-taking fund), data should be provided on the limited partners (Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order).

- (d) In a case where a third party is a collective deposit-taking fund, data should be provided on any beneficial owners and controllers, i.e. individuals exercising control of the collective deposit-taking fund through ownership means, other means or through the position that they hold (see Section 14.3.2 of the Regulated Financial Services Business AML/CFT Handbook (section 14 specifically addresses Funds and Fund Services Business)).

## 6.4 Meeting beneficial owners/controllers of customers

- K3 Does the deposit-taker have a policy regarding how often it should meet beneficial owners/controllers of deposit-taking customers, or other persons who must be identified under Article 3 of the MLO? (Yes ; No)
- 6.4.1 If the deposit-taker has a policy that requires it to meet beneficial owners/controllers of its deposit-taking customers on a periodic basis, please answer yes here.

## 7 Section KA - Beneficial ownership (lending)

## 7.1 General

- 7.1.1 Where CDD exemptions from applying identification measures under Article 18 of the Money Laundering Order have been utilised and no data is held, a deposit-taker is not expected to gather information for the purpose of completing questions KA1 and KA2.
- 7.1.2 Similarly, where CDD exemptions from applying third party identification measures under the Articles 17B-D have been applied to third parties this section does not apply.
- 7.1.3 Data in respect of using CDD exemptions under Part 3A is to be reported on the spreadsheet LA-DC Lending Use of MLO Concessions .

## 7.2 Lending customers - individuals and beneficial owners or controllers of lending customers that are not individuals

## KA1 Number and principal country of residence of:

- (i) individuals who are lending customers; and (ii) individuals who are the beneficial owner or controller of a lending customer that is not an individual, as at the end of the reporting period
- 7.2.1 The principal country of residence of a lending customer who is an individual, or the beneficial owners and controllers of lending customers who are not individuals, is recognised as a key factor in determining the riskiness of a customer - Section 3 of the AML/CFT Handbook provides further guidance.
- 7.2.2 The term 'beneficial ownership and control' is defined in Article 2 of the Money Laundering Order. It refers to the individuals who ultimately own or control a customer that is a legal person xi . In line with guidance provided in the AML/CFT Handbook, the following will be considered to be the beneficial owner or controller of a company.
- (a) Each individual with a material controlling ownership interest in the capital of the company (through direct or indirect holdings of interests (shares) or voting rights) or who exerts control through other ownership means.
- (b) To the extent that there is doubt as to whether the individuals exercising control through ownership are beneficial owners, or where no individual exerts control through ownership, any other individual exercising control of the company through other means.
- (c) Where no individual is otherwise identified, individuals who exercise control of the company through positions held (who have and exercise strategic decisiontaking powers or have and exercise executive control through senior management positions - directors).
- 7.2.3 Question KA1 requests a deposit-taker provide by country (using spreadsheet MADC Lending Country list ) the total number of lending customers that are individuals and the beneficial owners or controllers of lending customers that are not individuals. There is no need to report these figures separately.
- 7.2.4 Only positive responses are required i.e. there is no need to insert '0' against every country.

## 7.2.5 For example, using the data below, a response may look as follows:

| Customer type                                         |   Number of customers | Principal country of residence   |

| Trusts with non-Jersey  trustee                       |                     0 |                                  |
| Jersey Companies (4 shareholders each  with 25% share |                     1 | Jersey (2) UK Germany            |
| Non-Jersey Companies                                  |                     0 |                                  |
| Other - Jersey                                        |                     0 |                                  |
| Other - non-Jersey                                    |                     1 | Switzerland                      |

## 8.2 Deposit-taking customer identification and verification

- L1 Number of deposit-taking customers, as at the end of the data reporting period, where identity has not yet been verified as the relationship started before February 2008 and Article 13(2) of the MLO is being relied upon
- 8.2.1 Article 13(2) of the Money Laundering Order provides for the timing of identification measures for the existing customers of a deposit-taker at the time the Money Laundering Order came into force - 4 February 2008.
- 8.2.2 Article 13(2) sets out very particular circumstances which enabled a deposit-taker to delay verification of a customer's identity - Section 4.7.2 of the AML/CFT Handbook provides further guidance.
- 8.2.3 A deposit-taker should have finalised the position of its existing customers by 31 December 2014, unless a later date has been agreed by the JFSC (paragraphs 208 and 209 of Section 4.7.2 of the AML/CFT Handbook).
- 8.2.4 A deposit-taker should insert at L1 the number of deposit-taking customers where reliance on Article 13(2) is still being placed.

## 8.3 Reliance on obliged persons (Article 16 of the MLO) and persons in the same financial group (Article 16A of the MLO)

- 8.3.1 In line with Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order, reliance may be placed on an obliged person only where the six conditions, explained in Section 5.1 of the AML/CFT Handbook, are met. In practice, this has the effect of:
- (a) limiting the number of obliged persons that can be relied upon; and

- (b) requiring the basis for placing reliance to be recorded in writing.
- 8.3.2 Article 16A(2) of the Money Laundering Order defines who is to be considered a member of the same financial group:
- (2) a person is a member of the same financial group as another person if there is, in relation to the group, a parent company or other legal person that exercises control over every member of that group for the purposes of applying group supervision under -
- (a) the core principles for effective banking supervision published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (ISBN 92-9131-164-4);

- L6 Number of obliged person(s) and persons in the same financial group carrying on financial services business or equivalent business, relied upon as at the end of the data reporting period
- 8.3.3 It is important to understand the extent to which a deposit-taker makes use of these concessions and the geographical spread of the obliged persons and persons in the same financial group on whom reliance is being placed, consequently:
- (a) Question L3 requests the number of deposit-taking customers where reliance has been placed on obliged persons during the data reporting period (please insert '0' if no reliance has been placed);
- (b) Question L4 requests the country of the obliged person on whom reliance is being placed (responses should be provided on spreadsheet M-DC Country list, only positive responses are required i.e. there is no need to insert '0' against every country);
- (c) Question L5 requests the country of the person in the same financial group on whom reliance is being placed (responses should be provided on spreadsheet M-DC Country list, only positive responses are required i.e. there is no need to insert '0' against every country); and
- (d) Question L6 requests the number of obliged persons and persons in the same financial group split by the type of business that is carried on, at the end of the reporting period (please insert '0' if no obliged persons are used).
- 8.3.4 With respect to L3 and L6 please do not leave any green boxes blank, insert '0' as necessary.

## L7 Number of obliged persons and persons in the same financial group relied upon, who failed to provide information and evidence on demand and without delay, during the data reporting period

- 8.3.5 Where a deposit-taker relies on an obliged person or person in the same financial group, the Money Laundering Order (Article 16(5) xiii ) requires that a deposit-taker test, in such manner and at such intervals as they consider appropriate:
- (a) whether or not the obliged person has appropriate policies and procedures in place to apply the identification measures;
- (b) keeps the evidence of identity; and
- (c) will provide that evidence without delay if requested to do so.
- 8.3.6 In light of 8.3.5(c), question L7 requires a deposit-taker to report the number of obliged persons and persons in the same financial group that failed to provide information and evidence on demand and without delay.
- 8.3.7 Please do not leave a cell blank, insert '0' if either;
- (a) no obliged persons, or persons in the same financial group, are used or
- (b) obliged persons, or persons in the same financial group, did provide information and evidence when requested.

## 8.4 Exemption from applying third party identification requirements (Articles 17B-D of the MLO)

- 8.4.1 In line with Articles 17B-D of the Money Laundering Order, a deposit-taker may be exempt from applying identification measures in relation to a third party when the deposit-taking customer is:
- (a) regulated and supervised by the JFSC for AML/CFT purposes;
- (b) a person who carries on equivalent business (refer to Section 1.7 of the AML/CFT Handbook); or
- (c) a person who is wholly-owned by a person listed above and meets certain conditions.
- 8.4.2 The application of exemptions from identification measures is also always subject to one or more conditions (depending on the particular case). In practice, these provisions have the effect of:
- (a) limiting the number of customers to which exemptions from identification measures can be applied; and
- (b) requiring the basis for applying exemptions from identification measures to be recorded in writing.
- L8(a) Number of deposit-taking customers where the customer acts on behalf of third parties (eg pooled/omnibus/fiduciary accounts) as at the end of the data reporting period

## L8(b) Total deposits and other repayable funds held in such accounts (in GBP)

- 8.4.3 The AML/CFT Handbook (Section 2.3.1) highlights that when carrying out a business risk assessment a deposit-taker should consider the characteristics of the products and services it offers, assessing the associated vulnerabilities posed by each product and service. For example:

- (a) Products that allow a customer to 'pool' third party funds will tend to be more vulnerable - because of the anonymity provided by the co-mingling of assets or funds belonging to several third parties by the customer.
- (b) Products such as standard current accounts are more vulnerable because they allow payments to be made to and from external parties, including cash transactions.
- (c) Conversely, those products that do not permit external party transfers or where redemption is permitted only to an account from which the investment is funded will be less vulnerable.
- 8.4.4 Question L8(a) and (b ) request data such that the number and value of deposittaking customers acting on behalf of third parties can be determined.
- L9(a) With respect to L8(a), number of deposit-taking customers where exemptions have been applied to third parties for whom those customers act as at the end of the data reporting period

- 8.4.6 L9(c) requires an analysis of the number provided at L9(a) by the country in which the deposit-taking customer is regulated and supervised for AML/CFT purposes. Responses should be provided on spreadsheet M-DC Country list, only positive responses are required i.e. there is no need to insert '0' against every country.
- L10 Number of deposit-taking customers who failed to provide information and evidence on demand and without delay during the data reporting period, where exemptions have been applied
- 8.4.7 Where a deposit-taking business applies exemptions from identification measures, the Money Laundering Order (Article 17D(3)) requires that it must, in the manner, and as often as it considers appropriate, in all the circumstances, conduct tests in order to establish whether the relevant client -
- (d) has appropriate policies and procedures in place to apply the identification measures;
- (e) obtains information in relation to the third party;
- (f) keeps the  information or evidence of identity in relation to the third party; and

- (b) Products such as standard current accounts are more vulnerable because they allow payments to be made to and from external parties, including cash transactions.
- (c) Conversely, those products that do not permit external party transfers or where redemption is permitted only to an account from which the investment is funded will be less vulnerable.
