- (c) referred business (the extent to which clients are obtained on the basis of referrals from other businesses); and
- (d) cash and client account transactions (the extent to which cash and client accounts are used).

## 2.2 Risk Rating

- BA1 Number of clients in each category of risk (as defined by the Reporting Entity) as at the end of the data reporting period
- ((a) Higher; (b) Standard: (c) Lower)
- BA2 Do the Reporting Entity's risk ratings as specified above include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism? (Yes; No) If yes, please provide details at BA13(a)
- 2.2.1 Question BA1 requests data about the number of clients that have been assessed as presenting (a) higher, (b) standard or (c) lower ML/TF risk (on the basis of factors set out in section 3.3.4 of the Accountants AML/CFT/CPF Handbook).
- 2.2.2 Where use is made of a more precise risk scoring scale, it will be necessary to determine which categories in that scale approximate to higher ii , standard or lower risk. For example, if an accountant measures risk on a score of 1 to 10, it may consider anything between 1 and 3 to present a lower risk, 4 to 7 to present a standard risk, and 8 to 10 to present a higher risk.
- 2.2.3 If an accountant includes other factors e.g. commercial risk, in its risk rating of clients and the ML/TF risk element cannot be reported separately, please report the combined risk rating.
- 2.2.4 If a combined rating is reported please select 'yes' when responding to BA2 .
- 2.2.5
- For example an accountant with zero higher risk, 4 medium risk and 6 lower risk rating a client, should complete the fields as follows:
- Please provide an answer for every element of BA1. clients and who only considers money laundering and terrorist financing when risk
- 2.2.6 Please note the sum of BA1(a) to (c) should equal the sum of BB1(i) to (viii).

| BA1(a) - Higher   | 0                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| BA1(b) - Medium   | 4                             |
| BA1(c) - Lower    | 6                             |
| BA2               | Choose 'No' from the dropdown |

- BA3 If the Reporting Entity risk rates the beneficial owners/controllers of clients or other persons, who must be identified under Article 3 of the MLO, the number in each category of risk (as defined by the Reporting Entity) as at the end of the data reporting period ((a) Higher; (b) Standard: (c) Lower)
- BA4 Do the Reporting Entity's risk ratings as specified above include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism? (Yes; No; N/A) If yes, please provide details at BA13(b)
- 2.2.7 It is not a requirement of the MLO the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook for an accountant to risk rate the beneficial owners and controllers of their clients. However, the JFSC would like to understand the extent to which this happens in practice.
- 2.2.8 If an accountant does risk rate the beneficial owners and controllers of their clients, question BA3 should be answered. The guidance in 2.2.2 above should be followed where appropriate.
- 2.2.9 If an accountant does not risk rate the beneficial owners and controllers of their clients, please insert a '0' in cells BA3(a)-(c) and select 'N/A' from the drop down menu at BA4 .

- (b) client relationships that have been terminated due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns ( BA6 ).

This will include cases where:

- › it has not been possible to complete identification measures (before or during a client relationship) under the Money Laundering Order, including establishing the source of funds;
- › the ML/TF risk has been assessed as being too high (and so outside the accountant's risk appetite); and
- › there is suspicion of ML/TF.
- 2.3.2 This question applies also to cases where:
- (a) an application to form a client relationship or carry out a one-off transaction is handled by a third party, e.g. a law firm, and where there is no direct contact with the prospective client; and
- (b) an application to form a client relationship or carry out a one-off transaction has not yet been formally submitted, e.g. where CDD is applied at the time that business is being solicited (where this data is recorded).

- 2.4.3 Persons who refer clients to an accountant may be third parties such as lawyers, other accountants and trust company businesses.
- 2.4.4 Additionally, if an accountant is part of a group, any referrals from group companies or other branches of the same company should be included here. For example, if a Jersey accountant is part of a group/company that has a Guernsey company/branch then referrals from the Guernsey operation should be reported.
- 2.4.5 The following should not be reported as persons who refer clients:
- (a) a third party or group entity that acts as an obliged person under Articles 16 or 16A of the Money Laundering Order (data on these persons is collected through spreadsheet BD (Use of MLO concessions)); or
- (b) a client acting on behalf of one or more third parties (data on these persons is collected through spreadsheet BC (3 rd  party and beneficial ownership)); or
- (c) a person who refers clients on a basis that cannot be considered regular. The meaning of regular will vary by accountant and will depend on a number of factors such as the size of their current client base and the amount of referred business.
- 2.4.6 Note: A person may be classified as having referred business even if an accountant does not pay that person a fee for the referrals.

## BA8 Number of persons who referred clients to the Reporting Entity during the data reporting period, analysed by country

- 2.4.7 Question BA8 requires the number of persons who referred clients to be analysed by country, using spreadsheet BE.

- (a) the countries are listed on spreadsheet BE alphabetically; and
- (b) only positive responses are required i.e. there is no need to insert '0' against every country.

## BA9 Number of persons who referred clients to the Reporting Entity during the data reporting period, which carry on the following activities: (a) Lawyers; (b) Accountants; and (c) Other,

- 2.4.9 Question BA9 requires analysis of the number recorded at BA8
- 2.4.10 Where an accountant responds that the majority of the persons that are referring clients fall in 'Other' (BA9(c)) please provide further details at BA13 (General comments on section BA). This may include referrals from existing clients or referrals from another group company or a trust company business.
- 2.4.11 If an accountant considers that it does not have any persons that refer business then please insert '0' into each of BA9(a), BA9(b) and BA9(c).
- BA10 Number of relationships with persons who referred clients to the Reporting Entity during the data reporting period that were terminated due to CDD issues, or other financial crime concerns

- 2.5.2 This question is intended to determine the extent to which physical cash is still used in the accountancy sector. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not include bank transfers, cheques or any form of virtual currency transactions .
- 2.5.3 Whilst we recognise that the use of cash is minimal in the Jersey-based accountancy sector, it is important that this assumption is validated as cash transactions are a key risk indicator for money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
- 2.5.4 If no cash transactions occurred during the data reporting period, please insert '0' at both BA11(a) and BA11(b).

## BA12 Number and value of transactions through client account for clients during the data reporting period (receipt or payment) ((a) Number; (b) Value in GBP)

- 2.5.6 Whilst the JFSC understands that the use of accountants' client accounts is likely to be minimal, it is important that we collect information on the volume of transactions passing through client accounts, given that client accounts can be vulnerable to use by criminals.
- 2.5.7 Where a transaction took place in a currency other than GBP (e.g. Euros) please convert the transaction value to GBP using the most appropriate exchange rate.

- 3.3.6 Enhanced due diligence data in your workbooks should be provided in line with the requirements of the MLO . If enhanced due diligence is undertaken as standard on non-Jersey customers then all customers where standard CDD checks are applied should be reported as having been subject to enhanced due diligence. The data needs to accurately reflect the application of enhanced due diligence as defined in the MLO. If there is a significant difference between the number of customers who have enhanced due diligence applied to them and the number of non- Jersey-based customers, then please be ready to explain the difference.
- 3.3.7 If an accountant has no clients which have been subject to enhanced CDD measures then insert '0' in each blue box.

- (b) by a suitable certifier in line with section 4.3.4 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook; or
- (c) by a company in the same group as the accountant where that company is regulated and supervised for AML/CFT/CPF purposes (the meeting can be physical or through video conferencing facilities).
- 3.3.31 Where either the client or the beneficial owner/controller of the client has not been physically present and they are a PEP then question BB11 needs to record the number of such persons.
- 3.3.32 If, having taken account of paragraph 3.3.2, an accountant considers that all clients and beneficial owners/controllers were physically present for identification purposes please do not leave the cells blank, please insert '0' in each blue box.

## 3.4 Other client characteristics

## BB12

- Number that are regulated/supervised for AML/CFT/CPF purposes (i) Individuals - Jersey resident; (ii) Individuals - non-Jersey resident; (iii) Trusts with Jersey trustee; (iv) Trusts with non-Jersey trustee; (v) Jersey companies; (vi) Non-Jersey companies; (vii) Other - Jersey; and (v) Other - non-Jersey
- 3.4.1 Using the response to question BB1 as the base for responding, question BB12 collects data on clients that are Regulated and Supervised for AML/CFT/CPF purposes.
- 3.4.2 'Regulated and Supervised for AML/CFT/CPF purposes' specifically means:
- (a) subject to AML/CFT/CPF requirements; and
- (b) supervised for compliance with those requirements by the JFSC or an overseas regulatory authority discharging a similar function in respect of AML/CFT/CPF.
- 3.4.3 For example:
- (a) If the client of an accountant is a bank then they should be reported here. However, if the client is a subsidiary company of the bank which is not conducting a regulated and supervised activity, this should not be reported.
- (b) If the client of an accountant is a sole trader, who is Regulated and Supervised for AML/CFT/CPF purposes by the JFSC, then they should be reported here.
- (c) If the client of an accountant is a company acting as a trustee and is Regulated and Supervised for AML/CFT/CPF purposes, then they should be reported here.
- 3.4.4 If an accountant does not have any clients which are Regulated and Supervised for AML/CFT/CPF purposes please do not leave the cells blank, please insert '0' in each blue box.

## BB13 Number that are non-profit organizations

- (iii) Trusts with Jersey trustee; (iv) Trusts with non-Jersey trustee; (v) Jersey companies; (vi) Non-Jersey companies; (vii) Other - Jersey; and (viii) Other - non-Jersey
- 3.4.5 Using the response to question BB1 as the base for responding, question BB13 requests data about clients of an accountant that are a non-profit organization ( NPO ). In Jersey an NPO is defined in Article 1 of the Non-Profit Organization (Jersey) Law 2008 as being an organisation that:
- (a) Is established solely or primarily for charitable, religious, cultural, educational, social, or fraternal purposes with the intention of benefiting the public or a section of the public; and

- (b) raises or disburses funds in pursuance of those purposes.
- 3.4.6 Please note: in Jersey an NPO and a charity are not the same. The definition of a charity is set out in the Charities (Jersey) Law 2014 and not all NPOs are charities.
- 3.4.7 If an accountant does not have any clients that are an NPO please do not leave the cells blank, please insert a '0' in the blue boxes.

## 3.5 Accountancy services

## BB14 Number of clients to whom services are provided

- (i) Individuals - Jersey resident; (ii) Individuals - non-Jersey resident; (iii) Trusts with Jersey trustee; (iv) Trusts with non-Jersey trustee; (v) Jersey companies; (vi) Non-Jersey companies; (vii) Other - Jersey; and (viii) Other - non-Jersey
- 3.5.1 Question BB14 requests data about the services provided by an accountant to its clients. The objective is to analyse the response provided at BB1 into the number of clients to which each type of accountancy service is provided:
- (a) accountancy (question BB14(a));
- (b) tax advice (question BB14(b));
- (c) audit (question BB14(c)); and
- (d) insolvency (question BB14(d)).

## 3.5.2 Please Note:

The meaning of 'advice' in relation to tax can be widely interpreted and the JFSC takes the view that the provision of tax compliance services comes within the meaning of tax advice.

- 3.5.3 Where an accountant provides more than one service to the same client each service should be counted. It is understood that this will result in some double counting of clients.
- For example, Mr Brown receives both an accountancy service and tax advice from the same accountant, then Mr Brown should be reflected at both BB14(a) and BB14(b).
- 3.5.4 It is recognised that different risks are associated with different services and different clients therefore this section gathers data to enable the JFSC gain a better understanding of an accountant's risk profile.
- 3.5.5 Please do not leave a cell blank, please insert a '0' into all relevant blue boxes.

## 4 Section BC - Beneficial ownership

## 4.1 General

- 4.1.1 Where CDD exemptions from applying identification measures under Article 18 of the Money Laundering Order has been utilised and no data is held, an accountant is not expected to gather information for the purpose of completing questions BC1 and BC2.
- 4.1.2 Data in respect of using Article 18 is to be reported in response to question BD10 (Further exemptions from applying identification requirements (Article 18 of the MLO)).

## 4.2 Clients who are individuals and beneficial owners or controllers of clients that are not individuals

- BC1 Number and principal country of residence of: (i) individuals who are clients; and (ii) individuals who are the beneficial owner or controller of a client that is not an individual, as at 31 December 2023
- 4.2.1 The principal country of residence of an individual who is a client, or the beneficial owners and controllers of clients who are not individuals, is recognised as a key factor in determining the riskiness of a client - section 3 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook provides further guidance.
- 4.2.2 The term 'beneficial ownership and control' is defined in Article 2 of the Money Laundering Order. It refers to the individuals who ultimately own or control a customer that is a legal person v . In line with guidance provided in the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook, the following will be considered to be the beneficial owner or controller of a company.
- (a) Each individual with a material controlling ownership interest in the capital of the company (through direct or indirect holdings of interests (shares) or voting rights) or who exerts control through other ownership means.
- (b) To the extent that there is doubt as to whether the individuals exercising control through ownership are beneficial owners, or where no individual exerts control through ownership, any other individual exercising control of the company through other means.
- (c) Where no individual is otherwise identified, individuals who exercise control of the company through positions held (who have and exercise strategic decisiontaking powers or have and exercise executive control through senior management positions - directors).
- 4.2.3 Question BC1 requests an accountant provide by country (using spreadsheet BEAccts-Country list ) the total number of clients who are individuals and beneficial owners or controllers of clients that are not individuals.
- 4.2.4 Unlike other questions, there is no need to insert a response in each cell of spreadsheet BE-Accts-Country list .
- 4.2.5 For example, using the data at 3.2.3, an accountant may look as follows:

| Client type                                                    |   Number of clients | Principal country of  residence   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Individuals - Jersey resident                                  |                  10 | Jersey                            |
| Individuals  - non-Jersey  resident                            |                   2 | UK Guernsey                       |
| Trusts with Jersey trustee                                     |                   1 | UK                                |
| Trusts with non-Jersey trustee                                 |                   0 |                                   |
| Jersey Companies (4 shareholders each with 25%  share capital) |                   1 | Jersey (2) UK Germany             |
| Non-Jersey Companies                                           |                   0 |                                   |
| Other - Jersey                                                 |                   0 |                                   |
| Other - non-Jersey                                             |                   1 | Switzerland                       |

Spreadsheet BE-Accts-Country list would therefore have the following entries in the column for question BC1:

| ISO  Code   | Country     | Number and principal country of residence of:  (i) individuals who are clients; and  (ii) individuals who are the beneficial owners or controllers of  a client that is not an individual   |

## 4.2.6 Please Note :

Each individual should only be reported once.

The following are examples where an individual may have more than one relationship with an accountant but should only be reported once:

- (a) they are the beneficial owner or controller of more than one company; or
- (b) they are the beneficial owner or controller of a company and are also a client in their own right

## 4.3 Client acting on behalf of a third party

## BC2 Number and principal country of residence of third parties on whose behalf a client is acting

- 4.3.1 Question BC2 collects data on the principal country of residence of third parties on whose behalf a client acts.
- 4.3.2 For example, a legal arrangement cannot form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction itself. It is the trustee(s) of the trust or general partner(s) of the limited partnership who will enter into a business relationship or carry out the oneoff transaction with an accountant on behalf of the legal arrangement and who will be considered to be the client(s). In line with Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order, the trust or limited partnership will be considered to be the third party on whose behalf the trustee(s) or general partner(s) act(s).
- 4.3.3 In these cases the accountant should have identified the persons for whom the client is acting in line with Article 3(2) of the Money Laundering Order. Section BD Use and application of concessions granted by the Money Laundering Order

## 4.4 General

- 4.4.1 This section collects data about the application of concessions set out in the Money Laundering Order that can be used in the circumstances prescribed in Articles 13 (client identification and verification), 16 (reliance on obliged persons) and Part 3A (CDD exemptions).
- 4.4.2 The following table provides guidance on the period to be covered by each question:
