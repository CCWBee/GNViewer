## 1 General guidance

## 1.1 Scope

In 2018 we collected supervisory risk data from reporting entities for the first time. This exercise was repeated in 2019, 2020 and 2021. As advised on 3 December 2021 i , we are collecting the same data in 2022 in respect of 2021.

This guidance document relates to the Excel workbook in Section II of the 2022 risk based supervision data collection exercise that requires the provision of data in respect of Managed Entities (as defined at 1.7).

The form should be completed by a fund services business that holds the class ZK fund services business registration (Manager of a Managed Entity ( MoME )) in relation to its customers that are Managed Entities.

## 1.2 Data collected

Managed Entities remain largely excluded from the Section I data collection exercise however as a regulated person we require data so that we can risk profile these entities. Managed Entities are registered as a fund services business but are supported by an entity with the fund services business class ZK.

Consequently, some of the data being requested in respect of Managed Entities mirrors the Section I data request made to other fund services businesses.

In addition, the Excel workbook captures data in respect of the fund customers of the Managed Entity (see section 1.4).

## 1.3 Excel workbook

The Excel workbook that the MoME needs to complete, in relation to each of the Managed Entity that it acts for (using one line for each Managed Entity), comprises 3 spreadsheets, as follows:

- (a) MEA: Managed Entity Compliance Data - General Information
- (b) MEB: Managed Entity Compliance Data - Fund Customers
- (c) MEC: Managed Entity Compliance Data - Freetext

## 1.4 Fund Customers of the Managed Entity

The purpose of a Managed Entity is to act for public funds ( CIFs ), in particular Qualifying Funds (as defined at 1.7). As such it is anticipated that a Managed Entity will normally only act for Qualifying Funds.

However, we note that some Managed Entities may have disclosed in their applications, or subsequently, that they act in relation to a private fund as part of the fund structure.

In section MEB the MoME is requested to provide data in respect of the funds that each Managed Entity acts for, again using one line per Managed Entity.

The Managed Entities customers are the funds not the fund investors.

Where there is a fund with multiple sub funds but it has been issued with one fund certificate this should count as 1 fund.

Where the fund is a scheme this should count as one fund.

Guide to Section II of risk based supervision data:

Managed Entities

Include both Jersey and non-Jersey funds when indicating the funds the Managed Entity acts for.

In the event that any Managed Entity acts for a customer that is not a fund, provide details on the Freetext page (spreadsheet MEC).

## 1.5 Data reporting period

The Section II data reporting period is 1/1/2021 to 31/12/2021.

Generally, the data should be provided as at the end of the reporting period (31/12/2021 or closest business day).

## 1.6 Data submission

Whilst we will be collecting the same data as we did in previous years, MoMEs are still recommended to consider the data request as soon as possible. It may take some time to gather the data requested and the deadline for submission is 17:00 on 30 April 2022 .

Each MoME will be submitting a completed Excel Workbook in respect of its Managed Entities through myJFSC, and each MoME has a designated individual who is the myJFSC contact.

Notwithstanding who has responsibility for submitting the data, the board of the MoME should have oversight of the content of the submission made on their behalf.

For many this will be the fifth time the data return has been completed therefore we expect MoMEs to be in a very good position to report their 2021 data and that only on a very exceptional basis will responses be derived by extrapolation or estimates supported by specific criteria.

Where a MoME needs to extrapolate or estimate its data as system changes are being implemented, comments should be provided on spreadsheet MEC for the relevant Managed Entity, highlighting which data elements have been impacted, the extent they have been impacted and when the relevant system changes will take effect.

Where a MoME feels it necessary to provide additional data to enable us to understand the response, this information should also be included in spreadsheet MEC.

With the exception of spreadsheet MEC: Managed Entity Compliance Data - Freetext , all parts of each question should be answered. Consequently, insert a '0' where relevant, in each row.

Historically vehicles that were not truly private funds (as defined in the JPF  guide) were issued with consents under the CoBO by the Funds  Authorisation team, for example joint ventures. Therefore an assessment  will need to be done as to whether entities issued with a consent under the  CoBO are very private funds.                                                                             |

| MEB11                                                   | Number of funds which the Managed Entity acts for in the higher  category of risk (as defined by the Managed Entity) as at the end of  the reporting period This question relates to the number of funds that the Managed Entity acts  for. Where use is made of a more precise risk scoring scale, it will be necessary  to determine which categories in that scale approximate to higher, standard  or lower risk. For example, if a Managed Entity measures risk on a score of  1 to 10, it may consider anything between 1 and 3 to present a lower risk,  4 to 7 to present a standard risk, and 8 to 10 to present a higher risk.  If a Managed Entity includes other factors e.g. credit or investor eligibility  risks, in its risk rating of customers and the ML/TF risk element cannot be  reported separately, report the combined risk rating. |
