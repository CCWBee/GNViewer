## 1 Introduction

- 1.1 The JFSC will once again be requesting the provision of specified data through completion of a number of Excel workbooks. Section I of the exercise collects substantially the same data as in previous years except for 26 new questions that have been included for the 2023 reporting period. These are set out in appendix 5 of the Guidance to Section I of risk based supervision data 2023.
- 1.2 This guide is intended to assist Reporting Entities perform a 'sense check' on the completed Section I - Global Footprint Excel workbook prior to submitting it to the JFSC by highlighting the:
- 1.2.1 mandatory questions (section 2); and
- 1.2.2 relational questions (section 3).
- 1.3 On submission of your Section I Excel workbook you will receive an email confirming that you have successfully submitted your data. If you do not receive an email please contact myjfsc@jerseyfsc.org as there may be an issue with your submission.
- 1.4 Please note that whilst your submission may be successfully received by the JFSC, you may be contacted by a member of the Supervision division to discuss your data if any of the mandatory questions remain unanswered, or the relationship between certain questions has not been maintained.
- 1.5 To limit the number of 'failed' submissions, Reporting Entities are advised to consider sections 2 and 3 of this guide before submitting their data.
