## 1 General guidance

## 1.1 Scope

- 1.1.1 In 2018 the JFSC collected supervisory risk data for Reporting Entities for the first time. This exercise was repeated in 2019 and, as advised on 30 October 2019 i , the JFSC is collecting the same data in 2020.
- 1.1.2 This guidance document relates to Section II of the 2020 risk based supervision data collection which requires the provision of activity based data from Reporting Entities registered to carry on investment business, except those registered to carry on Class E investment business (see 1.1.4 below).
- 1.1.3 Investment business is a financial services business activity as set out in Schedule 2 to the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, specifically paragraph 4 of Part A of Schedule 2. Investment business is defined in Article 2(2) of the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 (FS(J)L) as follows:
- (2) A person carries on investment business if the person -
- (a) deals in investments, that is, the person buys, sells, subscribes for or underwrites investments, either as principal or as agent;
- (b) undertakes discretionary investment management, that is, the person decides as agent to buy, sell, subscribe for or underwrite investments on behalf of a principal;
- (c) gives investment advice, that is, the person gives to persons in their capacity as investors or potential investors advice on the merits of -
- (i) the purchase, sale, subscription for or underwriting of a particular investment, or
- (ii) the exercise of a right conferred by an investment to acquire, dispose of, underwrite or convert the investment.
- 1.1.4 The Schedule to the Financial Services (Financial Service Business) (Jersey) Order 2009 (Financial Service Business Order) specifies 5 classes of investment business

- 1.1.5 Please note that acting as an investment manager or investment adviser to a public fund is regulated as fund services business under Classes X and Y of the Financial Service Business Order respectively. Data in respect of investment manager and investment adviser classes of fund services business will be collected as part of Section II risk based supervision data: Fund Services Business and should not be reported here.

## 1.2 Excel workbook

- 1.2.1 The Excel workbook for a reporting entity carrying on investment business comprises 8 spreadsheets, as follows:
- (a) N - IB Compliance Data
- (b) OA - IB Client data Class A
- (c) OB - IB Client data Class B
- (d) OC - IB Client data Class C
- (e) OD - IB Client data Class D
- (f) P - IB - Beneficial Ownership
- (g) Q - IB Use and application of concessions granted by the MLO ii
- (h) R - IB Country List
- 1.2.2 Spreadsheet R is an input sheet for the responses to questions N8(i) to (iv), P1, P2, Q4, Q5 and Q8.

## 1.3 Clients

- 1.3.1 An investment business is required to complete the spreadsheets in respect of their clients.
- 1.3.2 A client is a person with whom the investment business transacts or has transacted business which falls within the definition set out in 1.1.3 above.
- 1.3.3 It is understood that an investment business may transact more than one type of investment business with a client. There are instances where the client should be reflected in all relevant spreadsheets. The JFSC acknowledges that this will result in an element of client double counting.
- 1.3.4 For example, where Class A (dealing) services are provided as an ancillary service to Class B (managing) or Class C (advisory) services, the whole of this client/portfolio should be recorded under the column relating to the primary services, namely Class B or Class C.
- 1.3.5 In contrast, if a client has separate dealing and managed and/or advisory portfolios, these should be recorded separately
- 1.3.6
- An example where a client should be reported twice:
- Mr X may transact the following investment business with investment business Y:
- (a) Investment business Y may already be managing a portfolio of investments for Mr X on a managed basis (Class B); and

- (b) Mr X seeks investment advice in relation to a GBP 50,000 which he has acquired as a redundancy payment (Class C).

In this case the Investment business would have one client but would need to report client data on both spreadsheet OB and OC.

## 1.4 Data reporting period

- 1.4.1 Generally, data should be provided for the period 1/1/2019 to 31/12/2019.
- 1.4.2 There are a few data items where the data should be provided as at the end of the reporting period (31/12/2019 or closest business day).

## 1.5 Data Submission

- 1.5.1 Whilst the JFSC will be collecting the same data as it did in 2019, investment businesses are still recommended to consider the data request as soon as possible. It may take some time to gather the data requested and the deadline for submission is 17:00 on 31 March 2020 .
- 1.5.2 Each investment business will be submitting a completed Excel Workbook for Section II through the JFSC Portal, and each investment business has a designated individual who is the JFSC Portal contact, which, in the vast majority of cases, is the compliance officer.
- 1.5.3 Notwithstanding that the JFSC Portal contact has responsibility for submitting the data, the board, or equivalent, of the investment business should have oversight of the content of the submission made on their behalf.
- 1.5.4 Having completed the data return twice the JFSC expects investment businesses to be in a better position to report their 2019 data and that only on an exceptional basis will responses be derived by extrapolation or estimates supported by specific criteria.
- 1.5.5 The JFSC continues to acknowledge that system changes take time to implement. Where an investment business needs to extrapolate or estimate its data as system changes are still being implemented, the comments section at the bottom of the relevant spreadsheet should highlight which data elements have been extrapolated/estimated and when the relevant system changes will take effect.
- 1.5.6 Where the investment business feels it necessary to provide additional data to enable the JFSC to understand the response, this information should also be included in the comments section at the bottom of each relevant spreadsheet
- 1.5.7 An investment business should complete all parts of each question on the relevant spreadsheets, with the exception of spreadsheet R-IB-Country list where it is not necessary to insert a '0' against each country.

## 1.6 Integrity checking your submission

- 1.6.1 Before submitting your data the JFSC suggests that the integrity checks highlighted in paragraphs 1.6.2 to 1.6.5 should be completed.
- 1.6.2 N1 analyses an investment business's client base into the risk ratings applied, split by class of investment business. The class of business totals in N1 should therefore agree to the analysis of the total number of clients by client type (OA1, OB1, OC1 and OD1):

- (a) Class A : sum of N1(a)(i) to N1(c)(i) should equal the sum of OA1(a)(i) to (viii)
- (b) Class B : sum of N1(a)(ii) to N1(c)(ii) should equal the sum of OB1(a)(i) to (viii)
- (c) Class C : sum of N1(a)(iii) to N1(c)(iii) should equal the sum of OC1(a)(i) to (viii)
- (d) Class D : sum of N1(a)(iv) to N1(c)(iv) should equal the sum of OD1(a)(i) to (viii)
- 1.6.3 N1(a) records those clients of an investment business that have been rated as presenting a higher risk, split by class of investment business. Consequently, the analysis of the total number of higher risk clients by client type (OA3(a), OB3(a), OC3(a) and OD3(a)) should agree to N1(a):
- (a) Class A : sum of OA3(a)(i) to (viii) should equal N1(a)(i)
- (b) Class B : sum of OB3(a)(i) to (viii) should equal N1(a)(ii)
- (c) Class C : sum of OC3(a)(i) to (viii) should equal N1(a)(iii)
- (d) Class D : sum of OD3(a)(i) to (viii) should equal N1(a)(iv)
- 1.6.4 Within the Client data spreadsheets there is an analysis of the application of enhanced CDD measures by number and value, the following checks can be applied to this data:
- (a) Class A : the number or value, in:
- › OA2 should not exceed that in OA1
- › OA3 to OA11 should not exceed that in OA2
- › OA11 should not exceed OA9 or OA10
- › OA11 should not exceed OA4 in any given column.
- (b) Class B : the number or value, in:
- › OB2 should not exceed that in OB1
- › OB3 to OB11 should not exceed that in OB2
- › OB11 should not exceed OB9 or OB10
- › OB11 should not exceed OB4 in any given column.
- (c) Class C : the number or value, in:
- › OC2 should not exceed that in OC1
- › OC3 to OC11 should not exceed that in OC2
- › OC11 should not exceed OC9 or OC10
- › OC11 should not exceed OC4 in any given column.
- (d) Class D : the responses, in:
- › OD2 should not exceed that in OD1(a)
- › OD3 to OD11 should not exceed that in OD2
- › OD11 should not exceed OD9 or OD10
- › OA11 should not exceed OD4 in any given column.

- 1.6.5 With respect to exemptions from CDD identification measures, Q11(a) provides the total number of clients to which these have been applied, this number is then analysed into the cases therefore Q11(a) should equal the sum of Q11(b) to (f).

## 2 Section N - Investment business compliance data

## 2.1 Overview

- 2.1.1 This section collects data on:
- (a) client risk ratings;
- (b) business which has been declined, terminated or withdrawn due to customer due diligence or other financial crime concerns;
- (c) referred business (the extent to which clients are obtained on the basis of referrals from other businesses)
- (d) cash transactions (the extent to which cash is used)
- (e) client assets under management; and
- (f) transaction monitoring
- 2.1.2 The responses to the following data requests should be provided by class of business: N1; N3; N5; N6; N7; and N11.

## 2.2 Risk Rating

- N1 Number of clients in each category of risk (as defined by the investment business) as at the end of the data reporting period
- N2 Do the investment business's risk ratings include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism? (Yes ; No) If Yes, please provide details at N16(a)
- 2.2.1 Question N1 requests data about the number of clients that have been assessed as presenting (a) higher, (b) standard or (c) lower ML/TF risk (on the basis of factors set out in Section 3.3.4 of the AML/CFT Handbook).
- 2.2.2 Where use is made of a more precise risk scoring scale, it will be necessary to determine which categories in that scale approximate to higher iii , standard or lower risk. For example, if an investment business measures risk on a score of 1 to 10, it may consider anything between 1 and 3 to present a lower risk, 4 to 7 to present a standard risk, and 8 to 10 to present a higher risk.
- 2.2.3 If an investment business includes other factors e.g. commercial risk, in its risk rating of clients and the ML/TF risk element cannot be reported separately, please report the combined risk rating.
- 2.2.4 If a combined rating is reported please select 'yes' when responding to N2 and provide details at N16(a) (free text box) of the other factors included.
- 2.2.5 Please provide an answer for every element of N1.
- For example an investment business which carries on Class A, B and C investment business and who includes factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism when risk rating a client, may have a response as follows:

|                | (i) Class A                   | (ii) Class B                  | (iii) Class C                 | (iv) Class D                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| N1(a) - Higher | 0                             | 2                             | 5                             | 0                             |
| N1(b) - Medium | 4                             | 15                            | 25                            | 0                             |
| N1(c) - Lower  | 6                             | 10                            | 54                            | 0                             |
| N2             | Choose 'No' from the dropdown | Choose 'No' from the dropdown | Choose 'No' from the dropdown | Choose 'No' from the dropdown |

- 2.2.6 N1 analyses an investment business's client base into the risk ratings applied, split by class of investment business. The class of business totals in N1 should therefore agree to the analysis of the total number of clients by client type (OA1, OB1, OC1 and OD1):
- (a) Class A : sum of N1(a)(i) to N1(c)(i) should equal the sum of OA1(a)(i) to (viii)
- (b) Class B : sum of N1(a)(ii) to N1(c)(ii) should equal the sum of OB1(a)(i) to (viii)
- (c) Class C : sum of N1(a)(iii) to N1(c)(iii) should equal the sum of OC1(a)(i) to (viii)
- (d) Class D : sum of N1(a)(iv) to N1(c)(iv) should equal the sum of OD1(a)(i) to (viii)
- N3 If the investment business risk rates any beneficial owners/controllers of clients, or other persons who must be identified under Article 3 of the MLO, the number in each category of risk (as defined by the investment business) as at the end of the data reporting period
- N4 Do the investment business's risk ratings include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism? (Yes ; No ; N/A) If Yes, please provide details at N16(b)
- 2.2.7 It is not a requirement of the MLO or AML/CFT Handbook for an investment business to risk rate the beneficial owners and controllers of their clients. However, the JFSC would like to understand the extent to which this happens in practice.
- 2.2.8 If an investment business does risk rate any beneficial owners and controllers of their clients, question N3 and N4 should be answered. The guidance in 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 should be followed where appropriate.
- 2.2.9 It is understood that an investment business may risk rate some but not all beneficial owners and controllers of their investment business clients, in this case please respond with respect to those that are risk rated.
- 2.2.10 If an investment business does not risk rate any beneficial owners and controllers of their clients, please insert a '0' in all cells N3(a)-(c) and select 'N/A' from the drop down menu at N4 .

## 2.3 Declined, terminated and withdrawn business

- N5 Number of applications from prospective clients to either (i) establish a business relationship, or (ii) carry out a one-off transaction, declined due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns, during the data reporting period
- N6 Number of business relationships terminated, due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns, during the data reporting period
- 2.3.1 In line with Section 2.4.1 of the AML/CFT Handbook (paragraph 32), questions N5 and N6 request data about:

- (a) the number of prospective business relationships or one-off transactions that have been declined ( N5 ); and
- (b) business relationships that have been terminated due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns ( N6 ). This will include cases where:
- › it has not been possible to complete identification measures (before or during a client relationship) under the Money Laundering Order, including establishing the source of funds;
- › the ML/TF risk has been assessed as being too high (and so outside the investment business's risk appetite); and
- › there is suspicion of ML/TF.
- 2.3.2 This question applies also to cases where:
- (a) an application to form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction is handled by a third party, e.g. a trust company business, and where there is no direct contact with the prospective client; and
- (b) an application to form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction has not yet been formally submitted, e.g. where CDD is applied at the time that business is being solicited (where this data is recorded).
- 2.3.3 Please do not leave fields blank, insert a '0' in all cells relating to N5 and N6 if no prospective clients have been declined or clients terminated.

## N7 Number of applications from prospective clients who have withdrawn due to CDD issues, during the data reporting period (where this data is collected)

- 2.3.4 Question N7 collects data on client applications withdrawn solely or partly on the basis of CDD requested.
- 2.3.5 It is recognised that this data may not be recorded by an investment business. If this is the case please respond with '0'. Do not leave the field blank.
- 2.3.6 This question also applies to cases where an application to form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction is handled by a third party, e.g. trust company business, and where there is no direct contact with the prospective client.

## 2.4 Referred business

- 2.4.1 Questions N8, N9 and N10 request data about those persons who referred clients to an investment business on a regular basis during the data reporting period.
- 2.4.2 Where business is referred to an investment business but neither a one-off transaction nor client relationship result this is not considered referred business for the purpose of responding to N8, N9 and N10.
- 2.4.3 Persons who refer clients to an investment business may be third parties such as lawyers, accountants and trust company businesses.
- 2.4.4 Additionally, if an investment business is part of a group, any referrals from group companies or other branches of the same company should be included here. For example, if a Jersey investment business is part of a group/company that has a Guernsey company/branch then referrals from the Guernsey operation should be reported subject to 2.4.5.
- 2.4.5 The following should not be reported as persons who refer clients:

- (a) a third party or group entity that acts as an obliged person (Article 16 of the Money Laundering order) or a person in the same financial group where reliance has been placed (Article 16A of the Money Laundering Order) (data on these persons is collected through spreadsheet Q (Use of MLO concessions)); or
- (b) a client acting on behalf of one or more third parties (data on these persons is collected through spreadsheet P (3 rd  party and beneficial ownership)); or
- (c) a person who refers clients on a basis that cannot be considered regular. The meaning of regular will vary by investment business and will depend on a number of factors such as the size of their current client base and the amount of referred business.
- 2.4.6 Note: A person may be classified as having referred business even if an investment business does not pay that person a fee for the referrals.

## N8 Number of persons who referred clients to the investment business, during the data reporting period, which carry on the following activities

- 2.4.7 Question N8 requires analysis of the number of persons between those that are:
- (a) Lawyers;
- (b) Accountants;
- (c) TCBs; and
- (d) Other, which includes any referrals from another group company that is not a trust company business.
- 2.4.8 Where an investment business responds that the majority of the persons that are referring clients fall in 'Other' (N8(d)) please provide further details at N16(c) (general comments on section N). This may include referrals from existing clients.
- 2.4.9 If an investment business considers that it does not have any persons that refer business then please insert '0' into each of N8(a), N8(b), N8(c) and N8(d).

## N9 Number of persons who referred clients to the investment business, during the data reporting period, analysed by country

- 2.4.10 Question N9 requires the number of persons who referred clients to be analysed by country, using spreadsheet R-IB Country List .
- 2.4.11 Please note:
- (a) the countries are listed on spreadsheet R alphabetically; and
- (b) only positive responses are required i.e. there is no need to insert '0' against every country.

## N10 Number of relationships with persons who referred clients to the investment business during the data reporting period that were terminated due to CDD issues, or other financial crime concerns

- 2.4.12 Question N10 requires an investment business to record the number of times, during the data reporting period, that a relationship between them and a person who referred clients has been terminated, by either party, because of a CDD issue or other financial crime concern.
- For example, in a case where the person referring clients considers that CDD measures applied by the investment business are impractical or excessive.
- 2.4.13 If no terminations have occurred, please insert a '0' in response to N10.

## 2.5 Cash transactions

## N11 Number and value of cash transactions (i.e. notes and coins) for clients of the investment business during the data reporting period (receipt or payment) in any jurisdiction

- 2.5.1 Question N11 requests data about the number (N11(a)(i) to (iv)) and value (N11(b)(i) to (iv)) of cash transactions (using notes and coins ) conducted for clients.
- 2.5.2 This question is intended to determine the extent to which physical cash is still used in the investment business sector. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not include bank transfers, cheques or any form of virtual currency transactions .
- 2.5.3 Whilst we recognise that the use of cash is minimal in the Jersey-based investment business sector, it is important that this assumption is validated as cash transactions are a key risk indicator for money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
- 2.5.4 If no cash transactions occurred during the data reporting period, please insert '0' at all cells for both N11(a) and N11(b).

## 2.6 Client assets

## N12 Total overall estimate of client assets (in GBP) under administration, held in custody, managed or advised

- 2.6.1 For the purpose of responding to this data request 'client assets' carries the meaning provided in Article 1 of the FS(J)L, namely: property belonging to a client, including money, investments and insurance policies; and
- any fund asset.
- 2.6.2 Note fund asset in this context refers to an investment held by the investment business client which meets the definition of units in a collective investment fund provided in paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 to the FS(J)L.

## 3 Sections OA to OD - IB client data

## 3.1 Client data overview

- 3.1.1 The JFSC recognises that an investment business may be registered to undertake one of more of investment business Class A, B or C OR an investment business may be registered to carry on Class D activity.
- 3.1.2 To gain a better understanding of the size and shape of the investment business industry and consequently the money laundering/financing of terrorism risks that may be present, the JFSC is collecting client data by class of business and within those classes by type of client.
- 3.1.3 Consequently, there are 4 client data spreadsheets:
- (a) OA - IB Client data Class A
- (b) OB - IB Client data Class B
- (c) OC - IB Client data Class C
- (d) OD - IB Client data Class D
- 3.1.4 NOTE: spreadsheet OD cannot be completed in conjunction with spreadsheets OA to OC but an investment business may need to complete one or more of spreadsheets OA to OC.
- 3.1.5 Sections OA to OD collect data by type of client in order to establish whether any particular client type exhibits higher risk factors than others. Responses need to be provided in the following client types:
- (a) Individuals that are Jersey resident;
- (b) Individuals that are not Jersey residents;
- (c) Trusts with a Jersey trustee;
- (d) Trusts with a non-Jersey trustee;
- (e) Jersey companies;
- (f) Non-Jersey companies;
- (g) Other - Jersey; and
- (h) Other - non-Jersey.
- 3.1.6 'Other' includes a client that is any of the following:
- (a) Foundations
- (b) Limited Partnerships
- (c) Limited Liability Partnerships
- (d) Separate Limited Partnerships
- (e) Incorporated Limited Partnerships
- 3.1.7 Sections OA to OD collect data about:
- (a) an investment business's clients which exhibit higher ML/TF risk characteristics; and
- (b) some specific client characteristics.

- 3.1.8 When completing sections OA to OD, data should be provided separately for:
- (a) incorporated cell companies - because they have a legal personality that is separate to the cell company; and
- (b) protected cell companies - because each cell may have different characteristics to other protected cells.
- 3.1.9 Where a client is a trustee (an individual or legal person), the data relating to that client should be entered in the relevant 'Trusts' column (Jersey trustee or nonJersey trustee) and not in the columns for individuals and companies.

## 3.1.10 Note:

- (a) Where a trust has both Jersey and non-Jersey trustees the data in respect of the value of deals and assets should reflect the structure of the trustees e.g. value of assets is £600,000 and there are 3 trustees of which 2 are Jersey Trustees and 1 is a UK trustee. The value of assets would be reported as £400,000 Trust with Jersey trustee and £200,000 Trust with Non-Jersey trustee.
- (b) Where deals are undertaken and assets held jointly by individuals the same principal applies, unless there is an agreement detailing the % holding of each individual e.g. a Jersey resident individual and a non-Jersey resident individual hold shares together with a written agreement that the shares are owned 60% by the Jersey resident individual and 40% by the Non-Jersey resident individual. In this case the £600,000 would be reported as £360,000 Individuals-Jersey resident and £240,000 Individuals-Non-Jersey resident.
- 3.1.11 All data should be provided as at 31 December 2019 or the closest business day.

## 3.2 Client data

## OA1(a), OB1(a), OC1(a) and OD1(a)

- 3.2.1 OA1(a), OB1(a), OC1(a) and OD1(a) request the total number of clients as at 31 December 2019 analysed by client type as listed in 3.1.4 and further explained in 3.1.6.
- 3.2.2 Please note that responses provided to OA1 to OD1 provide the base for responding to all other data requests in sections OA to OD.
- 3.2.3 For example, given a response to OA1(a) as set out in the table below then the number of clients is the maximum number that can appear in the relevant column for all other section OA questions:

| Ref         | Client type                        |   Number of clients |
|-------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| OA1(a)(i)   | Individuals - Jersey resident      |                 100 |

| OA1(a)(viii) | Other - non-Jersey   |                   1 |

- 3.2.4 Where an investment business has no clients of a particular type please insert '0'.
- 3.2.5 N1 analyses an investment business's client base into the risk ratings applied, split by class of investment business. The class of business totals in N1 should therefore agree to the analysis of the total number of clients by client type (OA1, OB1, OC1 and OD1):
- (a) Class A : sum of N1(a)(i) to N1(c)(i) should equal the sum of OA1(a)(i) to (viii)
- (b) Class B : sum of N1(a)(ii) to N1(c)(ii) should equal the sum of OB1(a)(i) to (viii)
- (c) Class C : sum of N1(a)(iii) to N1(c)(iii) should equal the sum of OC1(a)(i) to (viii)
- (d) Class D : sum of N1(a)(iv) to N1(c)(iv) should equal the sum of OD1(a)(i) to (viii)

- 3.2.6 OA1(b), OA1(c), OB1(b), OC1(b) and OD1(b) request data in respect of the value of clients, which should be reported as follows:
- (a) OA1(b) (Class A) - the settlement value of all deals undertaken during 2019 for the clients reported as at 31 December 2019 (purchases and sales should be aggregated not netted). For example, if, an investment business deals investment purchases with a settlement value of GBP 25 million and investment sales with a settlement value of GBP 30 million, then the value of that client is GBP 55 million.
- (b) OA1(c) (Class A) - value of assets held in custody. Also, see paragraph 1.1.5 for information regarding an investment business client that is a public fund.
- (c) OB1(b) (Class B) - the quarterly assets under management figure provided to the JFSC (split into client types).
- (d) OC1(b) (Class C) -the assets under advice value (split into client types).
- (e) OD1(b) (Class D) -the assets under advice value (split into client types).

## 3.3 Enhanced CDD measures

- 3.3.1 Information regarding enhanced CDD measures can be found in Section 7 of the AML/CFT Handbook.

- 3.3.2 In addition to an investment business deciding that a client presents a higher risk of money laundering or financing terrorism, there are some circumstances where enhanced CDD measures are required by Articles 15 and 15A of the Money Laundering Order. Such as where the client:
- (a) is, or some other prescribed person is, a politically exposed person ( PEP ) (Section 7.6)
- (b) has a 'relevant connection' to an 'enhanced risk state' (Section 7.5)
- (c) is a company with nominee shareholders or issues bearer shares (Section 7.10)
- (d) is a personal asset holding vehicle (Section 7.9)
- (e) is, or some other person is, not physically present for identification purpose (Section 7.4)
- (f) the client is provided with private banking services (Section 7.8) or
- (g) the client is non-resident (not a Jersey resident) (section 7.7).
- 3.3.3 With respect to 3.3.2(g), where an investment business's client is a non Jersey legal person this will require the application of enhanced CDD measures.
- 3.3.4 Additionally, there are scenarios where enhanced CDD is applied in relation to
- individuals connected to customers that are not individuals, such as directors who are its beneficial owners and controllers. For example, where a company has 3 individuals as directors, 2 Jersey resident directors and 1 non-Jersey resident director, an investment business will have applied enhanced CDD to the 1 non-Jersey resident director therefore the company should be counted as 1 in relation to the number of public funds that have had enhanced CDD measures applied and reported at OA2(a), OB2(a), OC2(a) and OD2.

## OA2(a), OB2(a), OC2(a) and OD2

Number where enhanced CDD measures have been applied:

OA2(b) Value of deals, during 2019, relating to the above clients (in GBP)

OA2(c) Value of assets in custody relating to the above clients (in GBP)

## OB2(b) and OC2(b)

Value of the above in GBP FOR

(i) Individuals - Jersey resident; (ii) Individuals - non-Jersey resident; (iii) Trusts with Jersey trustee; (iv) Trusts with non-Jersey trustee; (v) Jersey companies; (vi) Non-Jersey companies; (vii) Other - Jersey; and (viii) Other - non-Jersey

- 3.3.5 The question is designed to get a general feel for the extent to which enhanced CDD is used.
- 3.3.6 Using the response to question OA1(a), OB1(a), OC1(a) and OD1(a) respectively as the base for responding, question OA2(a), OB2(a), OC2(a) and OD2 requests data about the number of clients to which enhanced customer due diligence ( CDD ) measures have been applied as at 31 December 2019.
- 3.3.7 For example, using the example laid out in 3.2.3, if 18 of the 100 clients that are reported as 'individuals - Jersey' have been subject to enhanced CDD measures then respond '18'.

- 3.3.8 Using the response to question OA1(b), OB1(b) and OC1(b) respectively as the base for responding, question OA2(b), OA2(c), OB2(b) and OC2(b) requests data about the value of clients to which enhanced CDD measures have been applied.
- 3.3.9 For each relevant spreadsheet (OA to OD), if an investment business has no clients which have been subject to enhanced CDD measures please do not leave a cell blank, please insert '0' in each orange box.

## OA3(a), OB3(a), OC3(a) and OD3

- 3.3.10 Where an investment business firm has determined that a client presents a higher risk of money laundering or financing terrorism, enhanced CDD measures must be applied, therefore the response to questions OA3(a), OB3(a), OC3(a) and OD3 cannot be greater than the response to question OA2(a), OB2(a), OC2(a) and OD2 respectively.
- 3.3.11 There are circumstances where enhanced CDD measures must be applied but the investment business may not consider the client presents a higher risk, therefore the response to OA3(a), OB3(a), OC3(a) and OD3 may be lower than the response to OA2(a), OB2(a), OC2(a) and OD2. For example, a Jersey resident transacting though an asset holding vehicle or benefiting from services that are considered private banking.
- 3.3.12 For each relevant spreadsheet (OA to OD), if an investment business has no clients which present a higher risk please do not leave a cell blank, please insert '0' in each orange box.
- 3.3.13 N1(a) records those clients of an investment business that have been rated as presenting a higher risk, split by class of investment business. Consequently, the analysis of the total number of higher risk clients by client type (OA3(a), OB3(a), OC3(a) and OD3(a)) should agree to N1(a):
- (a) sum of OA3(a)(i) to (viii) should equal N1(a)(i)
- (b) sum of OB3(a)(i) to (viii) should equal N1(a)(ii)
- (c) sum of OC3(a)(i) to (viii) should equal N1(a)(iii)

- 3.3.16 On 12 June 2019 the Money Laundering Order was amended (see Article 15A(3) of the Money Laundering Order and Section 7.6.1 of the AML/CFT Handbook). From this date, enhanced CDD measures became mandatory for the following:
- (a) a domestic politically exposed person only where a high-risk business relationships or high-risk one-off transactions is involved ( domestic PEP );
- (b) a foreign politically exposed person ( foreign PEP );
- (c) a prominent person;

- › beneficial owners or controllers of a client;
- › a third party for whom the client acts AND the third parties beneficial owners or controllers ;
- › purporting to act on behalf of the client.
- 3.3.17 When considering whether a client is connected with a domestic PEP or foreign PEP it must be remembered that the definition of a PEP includes close associates and immediate family members of any individual. Close associate and immediate family member are both defined in Article 15A(3) of the Money Laundering Order.
- 3.3.18 The information to be considered when deciding if a person is a close associate of a domestic PEP or foreign PEP is limited to information in the possession of the investment business or information that is publicly known (Article 15A(4) of the Money Laundering Order).
- 3.3.19 For each relevant spreadsheet (OA to OD), if an investment business has no clients who are a PEP, or who are connected with a PEP, please do not leave a cell blank, please insert '0' in each orange box.
- 3.3.20 Using the response to question OA2(b), OB2(b) and OC2(b) respectively as the base for responding, question OA4(b), OA4(c), OB4(b) and OC4(b) requests data about the value of clients who are a PEP, or who are connected with a PEP.

- 3.3.22 Appendix D1 of the AML/CFT Handbook provides a list of the countries and territories that are considered an enhanced risk state. As at 20 December 2019 the following were listed:
- (a) Iran; and
- (b) The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea).
- 3.3.23 Section 7.5 of the AML/CFT Handbook provides further guidance, including an example of what may constitute a relevant connection.
- 3.3.24 For example: a client's source of funds is, or derives from:
- (a) assets held in either Iran or North Korea by the client or any person on behalf of a client; or
- (b) income arising in Iran or North Korea.

In either scenario the investment business should take reasonable measures to find out the source of wealth of the client.

- 3.3.25 For each relevant spreadsheet (OA to OD), if an investment business has no clients with a relevant connection to an enhanced risk state, please do not leave a cell blank, please insert '0' in each orange box.

20 December 2019

- 3.3.28 If the investment business, or another company in the same financial group, provides the nominee shareholders to the investment business's client then that client should not be reported here. The rationale being that the client is not higher risk as the additional measures recommended as guidance in the AML/CFT Handbook (paragraph 71 of Section 7.10) cannot be applied as they include using external data sources to collect information on the fitness and propriety of the nominee (such as its regulated status and reputation) and the particular country risk - this information is already known.

- 3.4.9 Within the investment business sector clients are considered to be either professional or retail. The Code of Practice for Investment Business ( IB Code ), issued by the JFSC, contains definitions of both a retail client and professional client (for ease these have been replicated at 3.4.13).
- 3.4.10 Guidance in the AML/CFT Handbook (paragraph 48 of Section 3.3.4) includes the following: In the case of Jersey residents seeking to establish retail relationships, and in the absence of any information to indicate otherwise, such customers may be considered to present a lower risk .
- 3.4.11 Questions OA15(a), OB15(a), OC15(a), OD15 (retail) and OA16(a), OB16(a), OC16(a), OD16 (professional) require an investment business to split the total number of clients reported at OA1(a), OB1(a), OC1(a) and OD1 into retail and processional.
- 3.4.12 Similarly, the values reported at OA2(b), OB2(b) and OC2(b) should be split and reported at OA15(b), OA15(c), OB15(b), OC15(b) (retail) OA16(b), OA16(c), OB16(b) and OC16(b) (professional) respectively.

## 4.2.6 Please Note :

Each individual should only be reported once.

The following are examples where an individual may have more than one relationship with an investment business but should only be reported once:

- (a) they are the beneficial owner or controller of more than one company; or
- (b) they are the beneficial owner or controller of a company and are also a client in their own right

## 4.3 Client acting on behalf of a third party

## P2 Number and principal country of residence of third parties on whose behalf a client is acting

- 4.3.1 Question P2 collects data on the principal country of residence of third parties on whose behalf a client acts.
- 4.3.2 For example, a legal arrangement cannot form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction itself. It is the trustee(s) of the trust or general partner(s) of the limited partnership who will enter into a business relationship or carry out the oneoff transaction with an investment business on behalf of the legal arrangement and who will be considered to be the client(s). In line with Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order, the trust or limited partnership will be considered to be the third party on whose behalf the trustee(s) or general partner(s) act(s).
- 4.3.3 In these cases the investment business should have identified the persons for whom the client is acting in line with Article 3(2) of the Money Laundering Order and the guidance provided in Section 4 of the AML/CFT Handbook. For ease guidance has been provided below:
- (a) In a case where the third party is a legal person (e.g. a company), data should be provided on the individuals who are beneficial owner or controller of that legal person (Article 3(2)(b)(ii) of the Money Laundering Order).
- (b) In a case where a third party is a trust (other than a collective investment fund), data should be provided on:
- › the settlor v ;
- › the protector;
- › beneficiaries with a vested right;
- › other beneficiaries and persons who are the object of a power that have been identified as presenting a higher risk; and
- › any other person who exercises ultimate effective control over the trust (Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order).

- (c) In a case where a third party is a limited partnership (other than a collective investment fund), data should be provided on the limited partners (Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order).
- (d) In a case where a third party is a collective investment fund, data should be provided on any beneficial owners and controllers, i.e. individuals exercising control of the collective investment fund through ownership means, other means or through the position that they hold (see Section 14.3.2 of the Regulated Financial Services Business AML/CFT Handbook (Funds and Fund Services Business)).

- 5.3.2 Article 16A(2) of the Money laundering Order defines who is to be considered a member of the same financial group:

- (b) Question Q4 requests the country of the obliged person on whom reliance is being placed (responses should be provided on spreadsheet R-IB-Country list , nil responses are not required);
