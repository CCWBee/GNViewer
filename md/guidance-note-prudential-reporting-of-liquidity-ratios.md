## 1 Summary

## Introduction

- This document specifies requirements that apply to JIBs relating to internal monitoring and prudential reporting of:
- the LCR/LMR - the liquidity ratios for which a minimum is established in Section 5 of the Banking Code - including HQLA ; and
- the NSFR .
- The relevant sheets in the Prudential Return are:
- HQLA : sheet '1.1 HQLA'
- LCR / LMR (as appropriate to the JIB ): sheet '1.2 LCR -LMR '
- NSFR : sheet '1. 3 NSFR '

## Overview

- The Banking Code requires JIBs to internally monitor the LCR/LMR daily and notify the JFSC if limits are not complied with or buffers not maintained. (See Sections 5 and 6 of the Banking Codes). This reporting must be consistent with the definitions set out herein.
- The requirements regarding the calculation and reporting of HQLA are based on the international standards promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) 1 .
- The specification defines both the definitions of the component items and the calculations that must be used to derive total HQLA and the LCR/LMR. Where component items are not relevant to a JIB, the JIB's internal monitoring need not reflect the term.
- The Banking Code also requires JIBs to submit prudential returns to the JFSC, consistently with this document, for each prudential period end date. The specific mechanics of this are set out in the 'Prudential Reporting Guide for JIBs', issued by the JFSC and available at:
- http://www.jerseyfsc.org/banking-business/prudential-reporting/
- For prudential reporting purposes only, this Guide also specifies the reporting of the NSFR .
- Appendices A to C list all items defined herein.

## Layout of this Guide

- Sections 2 to 6 and Appendix D to Appendix F relate to the computation of HQLA.
- Sections 7 to 14 and Appendix G to Appendix L relate to the subsequent calculation of the LCR/LMR, as applicable.
- Sections 15 and 16 relate to the prudential reporting of the NSFR.

## 2 HQLA

## Overview

- The requirements regarding the calculation and reporting of HQLA are based on those set out in paragraphs 24 to 54 of the LCR Standard . Appendix D addresses problems that arise where a jurisdiction has a shortage of qualifying assets (relevant for banks that have branches in jurisdictions where this is the case).
- There are two categories that can be included in the stock of HQLA . Assets can be included in each category if the bank is holding them on the reporting date, irrespective of their residual maturity. Level 1 HQLA can be included without limit, while Level 2 HQLA can only comprise up to 40% of the stock.
- Within Level 2 HQLA , there is an additional class -Level 2B HQLA (all other Level 2 HQLA being described as Level 2A HQLA ). These can, in total, comprise no more than 15% of the total stock of HQLA . They must also be included within the overall 40% cap on Level 2 HQLA .
- The 40% cap on Level 2 HQLA and the 15% cap on Level 2B HQLA must be determined after the application of required haircuts, and after taking into account the unwinding of shortterm securities financing transactions and collateral swap transactions maturing within 30 calendar days that involve the exchange of HQLA .

## General requirements

- Assets are considered to be HQLA if they can be easily and immediately converted into cash and at little or no loss of value. The liquidity of an asset depends on the underlying stress scenario, the volume to be monetised and the timeframe considered. There are certain assets that are more likely to generate funds (through an outright sale or a repo transaction) at or near face value even in times of stress.
- Appendix E sets out the factors that influence whether or not the market for an asset can be relied upon to raise liquidity when considered in the context of possible stresses. These are based on the LCR Standard . JIBs will be required to exclude potential HQLA items that do not have the requisite characteristics, even if they meet other criteria.

## Operational requirements

- All HQLA is subject to the operational requirements set out in Appendix F. The purpose of the operational requirements is to recognise that not all assets outlined in Sections 2 , 3 and 4 (those that meet the asset class, risk-weighting and credit-rating criteria) should be eligible to be included in the stock of HQLA , because there are other operational restrictions that can prevent timely monetisation during a stress period.
- These operational requirements are designed to ensure that the stock of HQLA is managed in such a way that the JIB can, and is able to demonstrate that it can, immediately use the stock of assets as a source of contingent funds that is available for the bank to convert into cash through outright sale or repo, to fill funding gaps between cash inflows and outflows at any time during the 30-day stress period, with no restriction on the use of the liquidity generated.

## Diversification

- The stock of HQLA should be well diversified across asset classes and within each. Although some asset classes are more likely to remain liquid irrespective of circumstances, it is not possible to know with certainty which ones will.
- Each JIB is required to develop policies and put appropriate limits in place in order to avoid concentration of asset and issuer types and currencies (consistent with the distribution of net cash outflows by currency) within asset classes. This should be documented in its LMP and reflected in its ICAAP document, within a section on Liquidity risk.

## Prudential reporting specific guidelines

- All reporting of amounts should be of the sterling equivalent amount, in round thousands.
- For individual items, an Unencumbered Holdings; Rehypothecated Holdings , Realisable Amount , Adjusted Amount and Haircut Amount are required to be reported, as follows:
- Unencumbered Holdings: for each item, this is the total value of the JIB's own holding measured at their balance sheet value less any amounts pledged as collateral.
- Rehypothecated Holdings : for each item, this is the total value of rehypothecated stock held by the JIB following the receipt of collateral (including as a result of securities financing transactions), less any amounts pledged as collateral, measured at nominal value.
- Realisable Value: for each item this is the total value of all relevant holdings (i.e. holdings falling into the Unencumbered Amount or Rehypothecated Amount ) measured at the higher of (if applicable) the:
- › Repo value (only assets for which a deep and active repo market exists): the maximum amount that would be received under a repo, applying prevailing market values and haircuts; and
- › Sale value : the current bid-price of the asset.
- Adjusted Amount : for each item this is the amount that is eligible, after considering the general and operational requirements and the JIB's diversification policy and any resultant limits that are applicable.
- Haircut Amount: for each item this is calculated as the Adjusted Amount multiplied by 100% less the applicable haircut (the haircuts specified herein range from 0% to 100%).

## 7 LCR/LMR

## Overview

- Sections 7 to 14 specify the calculation of the LCR/LMR - the liquidity ratios for which a minimum is established in Section 5 of the Banking Code.
- The effect of the LMR is to allow qualifying inflows from group banks to be treated similarly to HQLA , whereas in the LCR inflows are limited in effect . The LCR and LMR calculations are (respectively) set out in Sections 13 and 14 .

## General guidelines

- Three principles should be applied to all reporting and monitoring:
- JIBs should adopt a conservative approach to uncertainty. In most cases, specific guidance is provided herein as to the outcome required but if this is not the case a conservative outcome should be assumed for reporting purposes unless the JFSC's permission is received to use another outcome;
- JIBs must avoid double counting: Specifically, cash inflows relating to assets that have been recognised as HQLA must not also be recognised as inflows. This is most important when considering inflows but should also be considered when assessing outflows and JIBs should seek to identify situations where this principle is breached and consider the guidance provided herein regarding how to deal with the breach; and
- JIBs should classify items consistently in accordance with this guidance for all relevant purposes: Specifically, classifications used for prudential reporting purposes should also be used for internal monitoring purposes and to identify historical data and, more generally, when carrying out assessment of the appropriateness of Adjustment Factors within its ICAAP (the JIB' s documented self-assessment of capital and liquidity adequacy - see section 5.2 of the Banking Code ).
- Where specific guidance is not provided, JIBs should follow a course of action that is consistent with these principles and inform the JFSC of the specific issue and the course of action taken.

## Large adjustment rule

- The maximum adjustment permitted is £20 million per person or group of connected persons: referred to herein as the large adjustment rule . For example, if a deposit was £100 million then:
- if the Adjustment Factor for the category was 50% then £40 million could be included in that category (resulting in an adjustment of £20 million to the contractual flow), with the excess (£60 million) assigned to a category for which the adjustment factor is 100%, as indicated in the relevant guidance; and
- if the Adjustment Factor for the category was 20%, an amount equal to only £25 million could be included in that category (resulting in an adjustment of £20 million to the contractual flow), with the excess (£75 million) assigned to a category for which the adjustment factor is 100%, as indicated in the relevant guidance.

## Prudential reporting specific guidelines

- All reporting of amounts should be of the sterling equivalent amount, in round thousands.
- For each individual item the following must be reported:
- Balance sheet asset, balance sheet liability or nominal (as relevant);
- Contractually due inflow or contractually due outflow (as relevant); and
- Predicted inflow or predicted outflow (as relevant),

where:

- › Balance sheet assets/liability : for each relevant asset/liability: this is the total value of the JIB's asset/liability measured at the balance sheet value;
- › Nominal : defined for each classification of off-balance sheet items;
- › Contractually Due Inflow/Outflow : for each item this is the total value of all cashflows falling due within the next 30 days, including interest payments;
- › Predicted Inflow/Outflow : for each item this is calculated as the Contractually Due Inflow/Outflow multiplied by the Adjustment Factor applicable to the item, determined as specified herein; and
- › The Adjustment Factor used for each item will be determined through the JIB' s ICAAP submission and JFSC review process (excepting instances where no adjustment to inflows or outflows is required/permitted), subject to the relevant minima / maxima set out herein.

CM.03 should be used to report the total of all contractual obligations to extend funds to  retail and non-financial corporate clients within the next 30 calendar days (not captured  in any other categories) less 50% of the total contractual inflows due in the next 30  calendar days from such clients (IF.03 plus IF.06), to the extent that this is a positive  amount (do not report any negative result).  The  Adjustment Factor  applied must be 100% for CM.02 and at least 50% for CM.03 (as  determined by the  JFSC , following review of the  JIB's ICAAP ).

| DO.01  | Derivatives.  Calculate the  nominal  total of all transactions that could give rise to an  outflow. The  Contractually Due Outflow  for each derivative instrument is any net outflow  across the 30 day period, calculated on a net basis (i.e. inflows can offset outflows) by  counterparty, provided that a valid master netting agreement exists.   JIBs  should exclude from such calculations those liquidity requirements that would result  from increased collateral needs due to market value movements or falls in value of  collateral posted. Options should be assumed to be exercised when they are 'in the  mone y' to the option buyer. Where derivative payments are collateralised by  HQLA , cash outflows should be  calculated net of any corresponding cash or collateral inflows that would result, all other  things being equal, from contractual obligations for cash or collateral to be provided to  the  JIB , if the  JIB  is legally entitled (and operationally capable) to re-use the collateral in  new cash raising transactions once the collateral is received. This is in line with the  principle that banks should not double count liquidity inflows and outflows.  The  Adjustment Factor  applied must be 100%. See paragraph 116 in the  LCR Standard . |
| DO.02  | Miscellaneous.  Calculate committed amounts in accordance with  Appendix L .  The  Adjustment Factor  applied must be as determined by the  JFSC , following review of  the  JIB's ICAAP  and taking into account  Appendix L . See paragraphs 118 to 125 in the  LCR  Standard .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| IF.01  | Reverse repos, securities borrowing and margin lending.  Report the contractually due  inflow as being the amount receivable in the next 30 days.  The  Adjustment Factor  depends on the nature of the deal and on the collateral posted.  For maturing reverse repurchase or securities borrowing agreements secured by  Level 1  HQLA assets , the  Adjustment Factor  is 0% - no inflow is recognised. Note that the security  held versus these deals is counted within  HQLA and hence this is consistent with the 'no  double- counting' principle. For maturing reverse repurchase or securities borrowing agreements secured by  Level 2  HQLA  assets, the  Adjustment Factor  is the haircut applicable to the asset. Note that the  security held versus these deals is counted within  HQLA  after deducting the haircut and  hence, in total, this fully reflects the value of the asset, consistent with the 'no double - counting' principle. For maturing reverse repurchase or securities borrowing agreements secured by non- HQLA  assets, the  Adjustment Factor  is 100% - the inflow is fully reflected.  There are two special cases:  › Collateralised loans extended to customers for the purpose of taking leveraged  trading positions (margin loans) should be treated as per the above where the  loan is made against HQLA assets. However, for maturing margin loans made  against non-HQLA collateral an adjustment factor of 50% (not 100%) applies; and  › If the collateral obtained through reverse repos, securities borrowing, or  collateral swaps, which matures within the 30-day horizon, is re-used (i.e.  rehypothecated) and is used to cover short positions that could be extended  beyond 30 days, the JIB should assume that such reverse repo or securities  borrowing arrangements will be rolled-over and will not give rise to any cash  inflows (Adjustment Factor = 0%), reflecting its need to continue to cover the  short position or to re-purchase the relevant securities. Short positions include  both instances where in its 'matched book' the JIB has sold short a se curity  outright as part of a trading or hedging strategy and instances where it is short a  security in the 'matched' repo book (i.e. it has borrowed a security for a given  period and lent the security out for a longer period). |
| IF.02  | Facilities (Committed and Uncommitted).  Calculate the nominal as the total of all  facilities granted to the  JIB  except any that qualify as  HQLA . The  Contractually Due Inflow is the amount that contractually could be drawn in the next 30 days.   All facilities receive an  Adjustment Factor  of 0% and hence no  predicted inflow  will result.  Where  JIBs  have been granted access to contractual liquidity facilities provided by a  relevant central bank in connection with a branch where there is limited liquidity (see  Appendix D ), these should be reported as  HQLA  and hence should not be reported here.  See paragraph 149 in the  LCR Standard .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| IF.03  | Retail and small business customer inflows.  For the  Contractually Due Inflow , report  only inflows from fully performing loans that are classified as retail for credit risk  purposes under the  JFSC's  published guidance on the standardised approach to credit  risk. Inflows should only be allowed for at the latest possible date, based on the  contractual rights available to counterparties. For revolving credit facilities, it should be  assumed that the existing drawn element is rolled over and that any remaining facility is  treated in the same way as a committed loan facility.  Inflows from loans that have no specific maturity should not be included; therefore, no  assumptions should be applied as to when maturity of such loans would occur. Similarly,  where a contract provides for 'on - demand' repayment, such as sometimes seen with mortgage lending, it is proposed not to allow this to be assumed.  The only exception is that minimum payments of principal, fee or interest associated  with an open maturity loan may be included, to the extent that such payments are  contractually due within 30 days.

For revolving credit facilities, it should be assumed that the existing  drawn element is rolled over and that any remaining facility is treated in the same way as  a committed loan facility.  Inflows from loans that have no specific maturity should be included.  Operational deposits placed should be reported in IF.08.  Qualifying inflows should be reported in IF.05.

| IF.06  | Non-financial institutions . For the  Contractually Due Inflow , include only inflows from  fully performing loans to customers that do not fall within IF.03, IF.04 or IF.065. Inflows  should only be allowed for at the latest possible date, based on the contractual rights  available to counterparties. For revolving credit facilities, it should be assumed that the  existing drawn element is rolled over and that any remaining facility is treated in the  same way as a committed loan facility.  Inflows from loans that have no specific maturity should not be included; therefore, no  assumptions should be applied as to when maturity of such loans would occur. Similarly,  where a contract provides for 'on - demand' repayment, such as now sometimes seen  with mortgage lending, it is proposed not to allow this to be assumed.  The only exception is that minimum payments of principal, fee or interest associated  with an open maturity loan may be included, to the extent that such payments are  contractually due within 30 days.

| IF.09  | Cash inflows from derivatives.  The  nominal  must be the total of all transactions that  could give rise to an inflow. The  Contractually Due Inflow  reported should be, for each  derivative instrument, any inflow across the 30 day period, calculated on a net basis (i.e.  inflows can offset outflows) by counterparty, provided that a valid master netting  agreement exists.  JIBs  should exclude from such calculations those liquidity requirements that would result  from increased collateral needs due to market value movements or falls in value of  collateral posted. Options should be assumed to be exercised when they are 'in the  mone y' to the option buyer. Where derivative payments are collateralised by  HQLA , cash outflows should be  calculated net of any corresponding cash or collateral inflows that would result, all other  things being equal, from contractual obligations for cash or collateral to be provided to  the  JIB , if the  JIB  is legally entitled (and operationally capable) to re-use the collateral in  new cash raising transactions once the collateral is received. This is in line with the  principle that banks should not double count liquidity inflows and outflows.  The  Adjustment Factor  applied (as determined by the  JFSC , following review of the  JIB's |

## 15 NSFR

## Introduction

- This document specifies the prudential reporting of the Net Stable Funding Ratio ( NSFR ). JIBs are required to report consistently with it for each prudential period end date.
- The requirements regarding the calculation and reporting of the NSFR are based on those set out in the ' Basel III: The Net Stable Funding Ratio ' 2 , issued by the Basel Committee in October 2014 ( NSFR Standard ).

## Reporting guidelines

- All reporting of amounts should be of the sterling equivalent amount, in round thousands.
- For individual items, a Value ( balance sheet asset / liability or nominal , as relevant) and either (as relevant) the Available Stable Funding or Required Stable Funding , as applicable, are required to be reported, with the NSFR being the ratio of Available Stable Funding to Required Stable Funding . In the case of off balance sheet items, such as Derivatives and commitments, the nominal is specified herein.
- Available Stable Funding / Required Stable Funding : for each item this is calculated as the Value multiplied by the relevant factor ASF Factors or RSF Factors (as specified herein for each item).

## 16 NSFR Specifications

## Overview -Available Stable Funding

- Data should be input on the components of the JIB's Available Stable Funding (liabilities and equity) in accordance with the guidance provided in the table below

## Jurisdictions with Insufficient HQLA

## Eligibility for alternative liquidity approaches

- Some jurisdictions may have an insufficient supply of Level 1 HQLA (or all HQLA ) in their domestic currency to meet the aggregate demand of banks with significant exposures in this currency. To address this situation, the LCR Standard sets out three alternative treatments for determining eligibility of HQLA , which are expected to apply to a limited number of currencies and jurisdictions.
- Eligibility for such alternative treatment will be judged on the basis of the qualifying criteria set out in Annex 2 to the LCR Standard .
- The JFSC does not consider that, at this time, Jersey, or any other Crown Dependency, meets these criteria. However, it is recognised that JIBs may operate through branches that are in jurisdictions that both qualify and have adopted measures, which must then be subject to peer review.
- To qualify for the alternative treatment, a jurisdiction would need to demonstrate that:
- There is an insufficient supply of HQLA in its domestic currency, taking into account all relevant factors affecting the supply of, and demand for, such HQLA ;
- The insufficiency is caused by long-term structural constraints that cannot be resolved within the medium term;
- It has the capacity, through any mechanism or control in place, to limit or mitigate the risk that the alternative treatment cannot work as expected; and
- It is committed to observing the obligations relating to supervisory monitoring, disclosure, and periodic self-assessment and independent peer review of its eligibility for alternative treatment.
- All of the above criteria have to be met to qualify for the alternative treatment.

## Recognition of foreign use

- Where one or more local alternative approaches have been established by a local supervisor and that approach has been determined to be appropriate by peer review, JIBs that have branches in that jurisdiction may utilise the local approach to the extent that the alternative assets held meet liquidity requirements arising from liabilities held in that jurisdiction that are not met by HQLA held in that jurisdiction.
- Where no peer review has been published, a bank wishing to use a local treatment should provide the JFSC with full details of the local approach, including any self-assessment published by the relevant authority, any published plans to carry out such a peer review and the bank's own assessment of the approach versus the parameters set out in the LCR Standard , including the criteria set out herein.
- Approval will depend on all relevant circumstances. Any request and the approval granted will address how the additional assets should be reported within the relevant lines set aside for this.

## Outline of alternative approaches and reporting requirements

- Three approaches are set out in the LCR Standard . Each has its merits and issues and the below is only an outline of them. The LCR Standard sets out parameters in full but for each relevant branch it is expected that this would be supplemented with detailed local rules and that, in some cases, only one or two of the approaches will be developed locally.
- The request for approval would need to explain how the adjustments permitted under the local rules would be adjusted when calculating HQLA , taking into account the restriction in D.6 .

Option 1 -Contractual committed liquidity facilities from the relevant central bank, with a fee.

- JIBs would be granted access to contractual committed liquidity facilities provided by the relevant central bank (i.e. relevant to the currency in question), for a fee. These facilities should not be confused with regular central bank standing arrangements. In particular, these facilities are contractual arrangements between the central bank and the commercial bank with a maturity date which, at a minimum, falls outside the 30-day LCR window. Further, the contract must be irrevocable prior to maturity and involve no ex-post credit decision by the central bank. Such facilities are only permissible if there is also a fee for the facility which is charged regardless of the amount, if any, drawn down against that facility and the fee is set so that both banks which claim the facility line to meet the LCR , and banks which do not, have similar financial incentives to reduce their exposure to liquidity risk.
- If approved, relevant amounts should be included in the calculation of item L1.5 -Adjustment for branches in regions with limited HQLA.

## Option 2 -Foreign currency HQLA to cover domestic currency liquidity needs.

- Option 2 would allow supervisors to permit banks that evidence a shortfall of HQLA in the domestic currency to hold HQLA in a currency that does not match the currency of the associated liquidity risk, provided that the resulting currency mismatch positions are controlled within limits agreed by their supervisors.
- To account for foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency HQLA used to cover liquidity needs in the domestic currency, such liquid assets should be subject to a minimum haircut of 8% for major currencies that are actively traded in global foreign exchange markets. If the domestic currency is formally pegged to another currency under an effective mechanism, the haircut for the pegged currency can be lowered to a level that reflects the limited exchange rate risk under the peg arrangement.
- It is anticipated that most approvals might relate to Level 1 HQLA and hence should be included in the calculation of item L1.5 - Adjustment for branches in regions with limited HQLA. This will be confirmed (or otherwise) in any approval.

## Option 3 -Additional use of Level 2 HQLA with a higher haircut.

- This option addresses currencies for which there are insufficient Level 1 HQLA , as determined by reference to the qualifying principles and criteria, but where there is sufficient Level 2A HQLA . In this case, supervisors may choose to allow banks that evidence a shortfall of HQLA in the domestic currency to hold additional Level 2A HQLA in the stock. The additional Level 2A HQLA would be subject to a minimum haircut of 20%, i.e. 5% higher than the 15% haircut applicable to Level 2A HQLA that are included in the standard 40% cap. The higher haircut is applied to cover any additional price and market liquidity risks arising from increased holdings

of Level 2A HQLA beyond the 40% cap, and to provide a disincentive for banks to use this option based on yield considerations.

- If approved, relevant amounts should be included in the calculation of item LA.6 - Adjustment for branches in regions with limited HQLA.

## HQLA - General Requirements

## Introduction

- JIBs should assess assets and exclude any that, despite meeting the criteria set out in Sections 2, 3 and 4 , are not sufficiently liquid (setting aside liquidity provided by central banks or governments) to be included in the stock of HQLA . This assessment process must be described in the JIB's LMP and should cover the following:
- Fundamental characteristics; and
- Market-related characteristics.
- The test of whether liquid assets are of 'high quality' is that, by way of sale or repo, their liquidity-generating capacity is assumed to remain intact even in periods of severe idiosyncratic and market stress.
- HQLA should ideally be eligible at central banks for intraday liquidity needs and overnight liquidity facilities. Central banks can provide a further backstop to the supply of banking system liquidity under conditions of severe stress. Central bank eligibility should thus provide additional confidence that banks are holding assets that could be used in events of severe stress without damaging the broader financial system.
- JIBs that have direct access to central banks, including via overseas branches, should determine whether assets are eligible. JIBs that do not have direct access should still carry out the work but only consider assets to be eligible if (1) the assets are eligible at a central bank via a group counterparty and (2) there is a tried and tested operational route to access funding from that central bank via that counterparty.

## Fundamental characteristics

- Low credit risk: assets that are less risky tend to have higher liquidity. High credit standing of the issuer and a low degree of subordination increase an asset's liquidity. Low duration, low legal risk, low inflation risk and denomination in a convertible currency with low foreign exchange risk all enhance an asset's liquidity.
- Ease and certainty of valuation: an asset's liquidity is aided if market participants are likely to agree on its valuation. Assets with more standardised, homogenous and simple structures tend to be more fungible, promoting liquidity. The pricing formula of a high-quality liquid asset must be easy to calculate and not depend on strong assumptions. The inputs into the pricing formula must also be publicly available. In practice, this should rule out the inclusion of most structured or exotic products.
- Low correlation with risky assets : the stock of HQLA should not be subject to wrong-way (highly correlated) risk. For example, assets issued by financial institutions (other than PSE exposures where the PSE (1) has a clear public remit and (2) is not regulated as a bank.) are more likely to be illiquid in times of liquidity stress in the banking sector.
- Listed on a developed and recognised exchange: being listed significantly aids an asset's transparency.

## Market-related characteristics

- Active and sizable market: the asset should have active outright sale or repo markets at all times. This means that:
- There should be historical evidence of market breadth and market depth. This could be demonstrated by low bid-ask spreads, high trading volumes, and a large and diverse number of market participants. Diversity of market participants reduces market concentration and increases the reliability of the liquidity in the market.
- There should be robust market infrastructure in place. The presence of multiple committed market makers increases liquidity as quotes will most likely be available for buying or selling HQLA .
- Low volatility: assets whose prices remain relatively stable and are less prone to sharp price declines over time will have a lower probability of triggering forced sales to meet liquidity requirements. Volatility of traded prices and spreads are simple proxy measures of market volatility. There should be historical evidence of relative stability of market terms (e.g. prices and haircuts) and volumes during stressed periods.
- Flight to quality: historically, the market has shown tendencies to move into these types of assets in a systemic crisis. The correlation between proxies of market liquidity and banking system stress is one simple measure that could be used.

## Operational Requirements

## General requirements

- A JIB should periodically monetise a representative proportion of its stock of HQLA through repo or outright sale, in order to test its access to the market, the effectiveness of its processes for monetisation, the availability of the assets, and to minimise the risk of negative signalling during a period of actual stress.
- All assets in the stock should be unencumbered. 'Unencumbered' means free of legal, regulatory 3 , contractual or other restrictions on the ability of the bank to liquidate, sell, transfer, or assign the asset. An asset in the stock should not be pledged (either explicitly or implicitly) to secure, collateralise or credit-enhance any transaction, nor be designated to cover operational costs (such as rents and salaries). Assets received in reverse repo and securities financing transactions that are held at the bank, have not been rehypothecated and are legally and contractually available for the bank's use can be considered as part of the stock of HQLA . In addition, assets which qualify for the stock of HQLA that have been pre-positioned or deposited with, or pledged to, the central bank or a PSE but have not been used to generate liquidity may be included in the stock.
- A JIB should exclude from the stock those assets that, although meeting the definition of 'unencumbered' specified in paragraph F.2 , the JIB would not have the operational capability to monetise to meet outflows during the stress period. Operational capability to monetise assets requires having procedures and appropriate systems in place, including the function identified in paragraph F.1 , with access to all necessary information to execute monetisation of any asset at any time. Monetisation of the asset must be executable, from an operational perspective, in the standard settlement period for the asset class in the relevant jurisdiction.
- The stock should be under the control of the function charged with managing the liquidity of the JIB (e.g. the treasurer), meaning the function has the continuous authority, and legal and operational capability, to monetise any asset in the stock. Control must be evidenced either by maintaining assets in a separate pool managed by the function with the sole purpose being use as a source of contingent funds, or by documenting in its LMP how it has and will verify from time to time that (1) the function can monetise the asset at any point in the 30-day stress period and (2) the proceeds of doing so are available to the function throughout the 30-day stress period, without directly conflicting with a stated business or risk management strategy. For example, an asset should not be included in the stock if the sale of that asset, without replacement throughout the 30-day period, would remove a hedge that would create an open risk position in excess of internal limits.
- A JIB is permitted to hedge the market risk associated with ownership of the stock of HQLA and still include the assets in the stock. If it chooses to hedge the market risk, the bank should take into account (in the market value applied to each asset) the cash outflow that would arise if the hedge were to be closed out early (in the event of the asset being sold).
- In accordance with Principle 9 of the Sound Principles 4 , a bank ' should monitor the legal entity and physical location where collateral is held and how it may be mobilised in a timely manner '. Specifically, it should have a policy in place that identifies legal entities, geographical locations, currencies and specific custodial or bank accounts where HQLA are held. In addition, the bank

should determine whether any such assets should be excluded for operational reasons and therefore, have the ability to determine the composition of its stock on a daily basis.

- JIBs should assess whether it has access to large, deep and active repo markets for each eligible asset class. Where this is not the case, assets can only be included if it is likely that they could be monetised through outright sale. In these circumstances, a bank should exclude from the stock of HQLA those assets where there are impediments to sale, such as large fire-sale discounts which would cause it to breach minimum solvency requirements, or any requirements to hold such assets, including, but not limited to, statutory minimum inventory requirements for market making.
- In order to mitigate cliff effects that could arise if HQLA became ineligible (e.g. due to a rating downgrade), an asset remains eligible as HQLA for 30 calendar days from the date it fails to meet one or more criteria. This should allow the JIB sufficient additional time to adjust its stock as needed or replace the asset.

## Consolidated reporting

- The following is only relevant to JIBs where consolidated reporting of the bank is required.
- Qualifying HQLA that are held to meet statutory liquidity requirements at the legal entity or sub-consolidated level (where applicable) may be included in the stock at the consolidated level to the extent that the related risks (as measured by the legal entity's or sub -consolidated group's net cash outflows in the LCR ) are also reflected in the consolidated LCR . Any surplus of HQL A held at the legal entity can only be included in the consolidated stock if those assets would also be freely available to the consolidated (parent) entity in times of stress.
- In assessing whether assets are freely transferable for regulatory purposes, banks should be aware that assets might not be freely available to the consolidated entity due to regulatory, legal, tax, accounting or other impediments. Assets held in legal entities without market access should only be included in the HQLA calculation to the extent that they can be freely transferred to other entities that could monetise the assets.

## Rehypothe c ated assets

- JIBs should not include in the stock of HQLA any assets, or related calculated liquidity generated by them that, they have received under right of rehypothecation, if the beneficial owner has the contractual right to withdraw those assets during the 30-day stress period.
- Assets received as collateral for derivative transactions that are not segregated and are legally able to be rehypothecated may be included in the stock of HQLA provided that the JIB records an appropriate outflow for the associated risks.

## Pricing, including for financial statements

- In order to minimise the risk that a sale creates a loss, assets must normally be held at fair value in order to be eligible. However, if a JIB can demonstrate that a deep and active repo market exists, it may use an accruals basis for valuing assets in its financial statements but must compute the Realisable Value using the repo value -i.e. disregarding the sale value.
- For assets held in the banking book, the JIB must put in place processes to ensure that it holds up to date information on bid prices and on repo haircuts applicable to assets that it wishes to designate as HQLA . Such information must be refreshed daily.

## Retail Deposits

## Stable deposits

- The JIB must consider available evidence and determine if 5% appears appropriate. If not, it must determine what higher Adjustment Factor should apply. This should be documented in its ICAAP and will be subject to JFSC review.

## Less stable deposits

- For less stable deposits, the minimum projected Adjustment Factor of 10% must be considered in each JIB's ICAAP and will be agreed by the JFSC following its review.
- JIBs must classify such deposits into buckets: lower, higher, and no adjustment. It may use only the first and last buckets (if it does not wish to distinguish further) and may decide that no adjustment is appropriate for all retail deposits.
- For the first two of these buckets, the JIB must demonstrate in its ICAAP that a specific Adjustment Factor is appropriate, after considering stress testing and historical data.
- The last bucket is for deposits where the JIB considers that no adjustment is appropriate (and hence 100% of the contractually due amount should be included).  This must include large deposits from individuals (at least those exceeding £20 million) and from small businesses. Please note that the definition of a small business excludes any customer or group of customers that have deposits that exceed €1 million.

## Operational Deposits

## Qualifying criteria

- Activities in this context refer to clearing, custody and cash management activities that meet the following criteria:
- The customer is reliant on the bank to perform these services as an independent third party intermediary in order to fulfil its normal banking activities over the next 30 days;
- The services are provided under a legally binding agreement to institutional customers; and
- The termination of such agreements are subject either to a notice period of at least 30 days or significant switching costs (such as those related to transaction, information technology, early termination or legal costs) to be borne by the customer if the operational deposits are moved before 30 days.
- Qualifying operational deposits generated by such an activity are ones where:
- The deposits are by-products of the underlying services provided by the banking organisation and not sought out in the wholesale market in the sole interest of offering interest income. Specifically, brokered deposits are excluded; or
- The deposits are held in specifically designated accounts (not pooled) and priced without giving an economic incentive to the customer (not limited to paying market interest rates) to leave any excess funds on these accounts. In the case that interest rates in a jurisdiction are close to zero, it would be expected that such accounts are non-interest bearing. Banks should be particularly aware that during prolonged periods of low interest rates, excess balances (as defined below) could be significant.
- JIBs must determine the methodology for identifying excess deposits that are excluded from this treatment. This assessment should be conducted at a sufficiently granular level to adequately assess the risk of withdrawal in an idiosyncratic stress. The methodology should take into account relevant factors such as the likelihood that wholesale customers have above average balances in advance of specific payment needs, and consider appropriate indicators (e.g. ratios of account balances to payment or settlement volumes or to assets under custody) to identify those customers that are not actively managing account balances efficiently.
- Notwithstanding these operational categories, if the deposit under consideration arises out of correspondent banking or from the provision of prime brokerage services, it must be treated as if there were no operational activity for the purpose of determining run-off factors.

## Relevant activities

- The following paragraphs describe the types of activities that may generate operational deposits. A bank should assess whether the presence of such an activity does indeed generate an operational deposit as not all such activities qualify due to differences in customer dependency, activity and practices:
- A clearing relationship, in this context, refers to a service arrangement that enables customers to transfer funds (or securities) indirectly through direct participants in

domestic settlement systems to final recipients. Such services are limited to the following activities: transmission, reconciliation and confirmation of payment orders; daylight overdraft, overnight financing and maintenance of post-settlement balances; and determination of intra-day and final settlement positions;

- A custody relationship, in this context, refers to the provision of safekeeping, reporting, processing of assets or the facilitation of the operational and administrative elements of related activities on behalf of customers in the process of their transacting and retaining financial assets. Such services are limited to the settlement of securities transactions, the transfer of contractual payments, the processing of collateral, and the provision of custody related cash management services. Also included are the receipt of dividends and other income, client subscriptions and redemptions. Custodial services can furthermore extend to asset and corporate trust servicing, treasury, escrow, funds transfer, stock transfer and agency services, including payment and settlement services (excluding correspondent banking) and depository receipts; and
- A cash management relationship, in this context, refers to the provision of cash management and related services to customers. Cash management services, in this context, refers to those products and services provided to a customer to manage its cash flows, assets and liabilities, and conduct financial transactions necessary to the customer's ongoing operations. Such services are limited to payment remittance, collection and aggregation of funds, payroll administration and control over the disbursement of funds.

## Fiduciary Deposits

## Definition

- Fiduciary deposits, for these purposes, include:
- 'Swiss fiduciary deposits': amalgamated customer deposits placed by banks with other banks;
- Deposits from trustees on behalf of trusts, whether pooled or not;
- Deposits placed by investment firms on behalf of one or more clients, within an investment mandate; and
- Any other deposit that is known to be managed by a financial entity on behalf of a customer.

## Treatment

- The Adjustment Factor for fiduciary deposits must be 100% except with respect to qualifying outflows relating to PIC Deposits .

## The relevant conditions are:

- The underlying PIC must be a company or a trust whose owner or beneficial owner, respectively, is a natural person or a group of closely related natural persons, which was set up with the sole purpose of managing the wealth of the owners and which does not carry out any other commercial, industrial or professional activity. The purpose of the PIC may include other ancillary activities such as segregating the owners' assets from corporate assets, facilitating the transmission of assets within a family or preventing a split of the assets after the death of a member of the family, provided these are connected to the main purpose of managing the owners' wealth;

## Deposits must either:

- 1. be held on a designated account (not pooled) and not be managed through a brokerage arrangement or
- 2. be placed directly by the PIC (for example, where the financial entity manages the PIC);
- The adjustment should only be applied to deposits where the choice of bank is not actively managed in order to achieve an investment return. JIB s must specify criteria in their LMP s and reflect these when considering liquidity risk in their ICAAP . Deposits representing long-term investments, which must include all deposits placed with an original maturity exceeding three months, may not be adjusted; and

## The deposit mandate must either

- 1. not require the deposits to be moved in the event of a downgrade below a certain level or
- 2. in the case that it does require this, the JIB must be more than three notches above that level.

- Where these conditions are met, the JIB should apply an adjustment in accordance with any agreed by the JFSC following review of its ICAAP , with a minimum Adjustment Factor of 40% applying in all cases.

## Committed Credit and Liquidity Facilities

## Definition and nominal

- For these purposes, credit and liquidity facilities are defined as explicit contractual agreements or obligations to extend funds at a future date to retail or wholesale customers.
- Only include here contractually irrevocable (committed) or conditionally revocable agreements to extend funds in the future. Facilities that are unconditionally cancellable by the bank (in particular, those without a precondition of a material change in the credit condition of the borrower) must be excluded from this section and reported as ' Other contingent funding obligations '.
- All facilities that are undrawn and may be drawn within the 30 day period should be reported in the nominal figure, regardless of any facility maturity date.

## Calculation of contractually due outflow

- The contractually due outflow should be calculated as the nominal less any HQLA that has already been posted as collateral by a counterparty or that are contractually obliged to be posted when the counterparty draws down the facility (e.g. a liquidity facility structured as a repo facility), if the JIB is legally entitled (and operationally capable) to re-use the collateral in new cash raising transactions once the facility is drawn, and there is no undue correlation between the probability of drawing the facility and the market value of the collateral. The collateral can be netted against the outstanding amount of the facility to the extent that this collateral is not already counted in the stock of HQLA , in line with the principle that items cannot be double-counted.
- A liquidity facility is defined as any committed, undrawn credit facility that would be utilised to refinance the debt obligations of a customer in situations where the customer is unable to rollover that debt in financial markets (e.g. pursuant to a commercial paper programme, secured financing transactions or obligations to redeem units).
- The amount of the commitment to be treated as a liquidity facility is the amount of the currently outstanding debt issued by the customer (or proportionate share, if a syndicated facility) maturing within a 30 day period that is backstopped by the liquidity facility. The portion of a liquidity facility that is backing debt that does not mature within the 30-day window is excluded from the scope of the definition of a facility. Any additional capacity of the facility (i.e. the remaining commitment) would be treated as a committed credit facility with its associated drawdown rate. General working capital facilities for corporate entities (e.g. revolving credit facilities in place for general corporate or working capital purposes) will not be classified as liquidity facilities, but as credit facilities.
- Notwithstanding the above, any facilities provided to hedge funds, money market funds and special purpose funding vehicles or conduits, or other vehicles used to finance the JIB's own assets, should be captured in their entirety as a liquidity facility to other legal entities.
- For that portion of financing programmes that are maturing or have liquidity puts that may be exercised in the 30-day horizon, JIBs that are providers of associated liquidity facilities do not need to double count the maturing financing instrument and the liquidity facility.

## Calculation of Adjustment Factors

- Committed credit and liquidity facilities to retail and small business customers: 5% Adjustment Factor .
- Committed credit facilities to non-financial corporates, sovereigns and central banks, PSEs and multilateral development banks: 10% Adjustment Factor
- Committed liquidity facilities to non-financial corporates, sovereigns and central banks, PSEs, and multilateral development banks: 30% Adjustment Factor
- Committed credit and liquidity facilities extended to banks subject to prudential supervision: 40% Adjustment Factor
- Committed credit facilities to other financial institutions, including securities firms, insurance companies, fiduciaries, and beneficiaries : 40% Adjustment Factor
- Committed liquidity facilities to other financial institutions, including securities firms, insurance companies, fiduciaries, and beneficiaries: 100% Adjustment Factor
- Committed credit and liquidity facilities to other legal entities (including SPEs, conduits and special purpose vehicles, and other entities not included in the prior categories): 100% Adjustment Factor

## Other Contingent Funding Obligations

## Definition and nominal

- Contingent funding obligations may be either contractual or non-contractual and are not pure lending commitments. Non-contractual contingent funding obligations include associations with, or sponsorship of, products sold or services provided that may require the support or extension of funds in the future under stressed conditions. Non-contractual obligations may be embedded in financial products and instruments sold, sponsored, or originated by the institution that can give rise to unplanned balance sheet growth arising from support given for reputational risk considerations. These include products and instruments for which the customer or holder has specific expectations regarding the liquidity and marketability of the product or instrument and for which failure to satisfy customer expectations in a commercially reasonable manner would likely cause material reputational damage to the institution or otherwise impair ongoing viability.
- Some of these contingent funding obligations are explicitly contingent upon a credit or other event that is not always related to the liquidity events simulated in the stress scenario, but may nevertheless have the potential to cause significant liquidity drains in times of stress.
- In all cases, the nominal should be the total undrawn amount that could be drawn within the 30 day period and the contractually due amount should normally be equivalent to the nominal, save for unusual circumstances where the draw would require the provision of collateral in the form of HQLA (see J.4 )
- Non contractual contingent funding obligations related to potential liquidity draws from joint ventures or minority investments, which are not consolidated, should be reported where there is the expectation that the JIB will be the main liquidity provider when the entity is in need of liquidity.

## Adjustment Factors

- Each JIB should consider which of these other contingent funding obligations may materialise under the assumed stress events in its ICAAP . JIBs may always use a 100% Adjustment Factor or may choose to use the adjustment factors applying to similar committed facilities or may seek to determine them based only on stress testing.
- In the case of contingent funding obligations stemming from trade finance instruments, the floor for the rate is 5%. Trade finance instruments consist of trade-related obligations directly underpinned by the movement of goods or the provision of services, such as:
- documentary trade letters of credit, documentary and clean collections, import bills, and export bills; and
- guarantees directly related to trade finance obligations, such as shipping guarantees.

- Lending commitments, such as direct import or export financing for non-financial corporate firms, are excluded from this treatment and banks must apply the draw-down rates specified in Section 10.
- Other contingent funding obligations for which run-off rates must be determined should include products and instruments such as:
- unconditionally revocable 'uncommitted" credit and liquidity facilities (capped at the rate that would apply if the facility was fully committed);
- guarantees and letters of credit unrelated to trade finance obligations;
- non-contractual obligations such as:
- › potential requests for debt repurchases of the bank's own debt or that of related conduits, securities investment vehicles and other such financing facilities;
- › structured products where customers anticipate ready marketability, such as adjustable rate notes and variable rate demand notes (VRDNs); and
- › managed funds that are marketed with the objective of maintaining a stable value such as money market mutual funds or other types of stable value collective investment funds.
- For issuers with an affiliated dealer or market maker, there may be a need to include part of the outstanding debt securities (unsecured and secured, term as well as short-term) having maturities greater than 30 calendar days, to cover potential repurchase.
- Non contractual obligations where customer short positions are covered by other customers' collateral: A minimum 50% run-off factor of the contingent obligations should be applied where JIBs have internally matched client assets against other clients' short positions where the collateral does not qualify as Level 1 or Level 2, and the bank may be obligated to find additional sources of funding for these positions in the event of client withdrawals.

## Miscellaneous Outflows

## Explanation

- This appendix establishes the outflow percentages that would apply to cashflow items not connected with maturing funding, commitments or directly resulting from booked derivatives. In all cases, the nominal should be the total volume of relevant instrument and, unless otherwise stated, the Adjustment Factor applying should be 100%.

Increased liquidity needs related to downgrade triggers embedded in financing transactions, derivatives and other contracts

- Contractually due outflow : 100% of the amount of collateral that would be posted for, or contractual cash outflows associated with, any downgrade up to and including a 3-notch downgrade from the current position.
- Triggers linked to a bank's short -term rating should be assumed to be triggered at the corresponding long-term rating in accordance with published ratings criteria. The impact of the downgrade should consider impacts on all types of margin collateral and contractual triggers which change rehypothecation rights for non-segregated collateral.

Increased liquidity needs related to the potential for valuation changes on posted collateral securing derivatives and other transactions

- Contractually due outflow : 20% of the value of non-Level 1 posted collateral.
- This must be calculated based on the notional amount required to be posted as collateral after any other haircuts have been applied that may be applicable to the collateral category. Any collateral that is in a segregated margin account can only be used to offset outflows that are associated with payments that are eligible to be offset from that same account.

Increased liquidity needs related to excess non-segregated collateral held by the bank that could contractually be called at any time by the counterparty

- Contractually due outflow : 100% of the non-segregated collateral that could contractually be recalled by the counterparty because the collateral is in excess of the counterparty's current collateral requirements.

Increased liquidity needs related to contractually required collateral on transactions for which the counterparty has not yet demanded the collateral be posted

- Contractually due outflow : 100% of the collateral that is contractually due but where the counterparty has not yet demanded the posting of such collateral.

## Increased liquidity needs related to contracts that allow collateral substitution to nonHQLA assets

- Contractually due outflow : 100% of the amount of HQLA collateral that can be substituted for nonHQLA assets without the bank's consent that have been received to secure transactions that have not been segregated.

## Increased liquidity needs related to market valuation changes on derivatives or other transactions

- Contractually due outflow : Report as equal to the nominal
- Rather than applying an Adjustment Factor, calculate the predicted outflow as being the largest absolute net 30-day collateral flow seen during the preceding 24 months. The absolute net collateral flow is based on both realised outflows and inflows. JIB's need only recalculate this for each prudential reporting period, maintaining this value for all internal monitoring until next recalculated.

## Loss of funding on asset-backed commercial paper, conduits, securities investment vehicles and other such financing facilities

| Potential Risk Element                                                                                          | Contractual due outflow                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Debt maturing within the calculation period                                                                     | 100% of maturing amount                                                                      |
| Embedded options in financing arrangements  that allow for the return of assets or potential  liquidity support | 100% of the amount of assets that  could potentially be returned, or the  liquidity required |

- JIBs having structured financing facilities that include the issuance of short-term debt instruments, such as asset backed commercial paper, should fully consider the potential liquidity risk arising from these structures. These risks include, but are not limited to (i) the inability to refinance maturing debt and (ii) the existence of derivatives or derivative-like components contractually written into the documentation associated with the structure that would effectively allow the financing arrangement to be ended ('liquidity puts') within the 30 -day period (such as measures that permit the 'return' of assets in a financing arrangement, or that require the original asset transferor to provide liquidity).
- Where the structured financing activities of a bank are conducted through a SPE (such as a special purpose vehicle, conduit or structured investment vehicle), the JIB should, in determining the HQLA requirements, look through to the maturity of the debt instruments issued by the entity and any embedded options in financing arrangements that may potentially trigger the 'return' of assets or require liquidity to be provided to the SPE, irrespective of whether or not the SPE is consolidated.
