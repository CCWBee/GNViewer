4.1.2.2

protect and enhance the reputation and integrity of Jersey in commercial and financial matters;

4.1.2.3

safeguard the best economic interests of Jersey; and

counter financial crime both in Jersey and elsewhere.

## 5 What is covered?

## High risk factors

- 5.1 The Registry has adopted measures to apply a risk based approach to its determination of applications and in doing so, due regard will be given to:
- 5.1.1 The Handbook for the Prevention and Detection of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (the AML/CFT Handbook ), in particular, Part 1, Section 3 Customer due diligence requirements and Appendices D1 and D2;
- 5.1.2 the Corruption (Jersey) Law 2006;
- 5.1.3 Sanctions; and
- 5.1.4 Proliferation and Proliferation Financing Guidance.
- 5.2 In determining applications made by way of published application form, the Companies Registry will consider a number of higher risk areas. The published application forms provide applicants with a means of stating which higher risks, if any, are present. However, the JFSC reserves the right to consider matters wider than those stated on the application form in order to properly assess and protect the Island's reputation and integrity in commercial and financial matters.
- 5.3 One area of risk the Registry will consider is the potential risks posed by the ultimate beneficial owners/controllers/founders/partners. In particular:
- 5.4 The published application forms require the disclosure of higher risk factors, exhibited by the ultimate beneficial owners/controllers/founders/partners and in particular applicants are required by way of submitting the published application forms to:
- 5.4.1 confirm, that in completing due diligence, due regard has been given to items 5.3.1.1 to 5.3.1.4 above; and
- 5.4.2 provide details to 5.3.1.5 above.

| 5.3.1.5   | Provide details, in a free text box 'other relevant details' of any other  higher risk factors, identified during the course of completing due  diligence, that pose a potential reputation risk to Jersey. |

## Activities posing potential reputational risks

- 5.4.3 The Companies Registry has published a Sound Business Practice Policy and published application forms. This provides applicants with a means of stating what, if any, intended activities pose potential reputational risks. A sensitive activity is an

activity that appears in either Table 1 or Table 2 of the Sound Business Practice Policy. For further information see Section 7.

## 6 Processing applications featuring higher risk factors and activities posing potential reputational risks

## Generally

- 6.1 Where applications fall within the scope of the sound business practice policy, the Companies Registry will not guarantee a fast track service .  Applicants are encouraged to contact the Registry, in advance of submitting an application, so as to promote a clear understanding of the additional information required and the likely processing service level.
- 6.2 The Companies Registry will assess relevant applications, on a case by case basis , following the standard assessment and evaluation using external data sources. The results of this process will inform Registry's contact with applicants and requirements for the provision of additional information and/or questions to be answered.
- 6.3 In instances where the Companies Registry identifies such factors and determines that an application is materially inaccurate/inadequate/incomplete, any one or more of the following actions will be considered:
- 6.3.1 informing the applicant that the processing clock has stopped;
- 6.3.2 returning the application in order for it to be properly executed;
- 6.3.3 referral to the JFSC's trust company business division for an assessment against the regulatory requirements; and/or
- 6.3.4 in circumstances where there has been repeated incidences of deficient applications received from the same service provider, the Registry will consider whether a suspension of the standard trust company business COBO exemption and/or fast track service level should apply.
- 6.4 It is noted that, in some circumstances, applicants may during this process withdraw an application. In such situations and in the absence of exceptional circumstances the application fee will not be refunded.
- 6.5 The Companies Registry will, following its initial assessment and evaluation, contact applicants setting out, on a case by case basis , the action it will take to fully understand the risk factors associated with the application and potential mitigation by the applicant.

## 7 Activities posing potential reputational risks

## Table 1 - Activities 1 - 5

- 7.1 Activities falling into one or more of these categories will require registration under the Regulatory Laws ii , and Registry will liaise with the relevant Supervisory Divisions within the JFSC when processing such applications.
- 7.2 The relevant regulatory application form must be fully completed, but the Registry will seek to minimise, as far as is possible, duplication of supporting submissions by working closely with the relevant Supervisory Divisions.

- 7.3 Depending on when, in the application for registration under the Regulatory Laws, the application for incorporation is made, the Companies Registry will take the following action:
- 7.3.1 Where an application under the Regulatory Laws has been successfully determined in principle prior to application for incorporation, the fast track service may be utilised.
- 7.3.2 Where application for incorporation predates determination of an application under the Regulatory Laws, the Companies Registry will seek undertakings from the subscribers/director confirming that:

- 7.3.2.1 the regulated activity will not be undertaken unless and until the

relevant registration is granted; and

- 7.3.2.2 if the relevant registration is not granted, that the entity will be

wound-up within agreed timescales.

## Holding companies with reference to Table 1 - Activities

- 7.4 Registry will need to understand the nature of the investments to be held by the proposed Jersey holding company, and this may be achieved by way of submission of a proposed structure chart setting out the entities to be held, their jurisdiction of incorporation, activity and, where appropriate, name of the regulatory body.
- 7.5 Furthermore, the Registry will require confirmation, from the applicant, as to whether the activity of the Jersey holding company and/or its underlying subsidiaries would fall within the scope of the Regulatory Laws.
- 7.6 The Companies Registry will, having due regard to the information provided, follow its process for holding companies applications which feature Table 1 activities as described in Appendix A.

## Non-Profit organizations

- 7.7 Activities falling into this category will require registration under the Proceeds of Crime (Supervisory Bodies) (Jersey) Law 2008 and Registry will liaise with the relevant supervisory Division in the JFSC when processing such applications.

## Table 2 Activities

- 7.8 The Companies Registry will, following its initial assessment and evaluation, contact applicants setting out, on a case by case basis , the action it will take to fully understand the risk factors associated with the application and potential mitigation by the applicant.  For example, where Activity 1 is proposed, Registry will seek to understand what form of scheme of financial protection will be available to its customers.  In the case of a travel agency this might involve membership of ABTA (Association of British Travel Agents).
- 7.9 Where the Policy is wide in context, such as Activity 4 'Conduct of scientific research', the JFSC is looking to take a pragmatic approach concentrating on those activities which would pose a significant reputational risk to the Island, for example: nuclear weapons research.
- 7.10 In respect of any activity relating to cryptocurrencies and/or initial coin offerings, the JFSC will be guided by the ICO Guidance issued by the JFSC, as updated from time to time, and will have due regard to the Government policy statement on Initial Coin Offerings issued on 13 December 2017.

- 7.11 All applications made to the Companies Registry are to be made in the manner and form set out by the JFSC.
- 7.12 Where a person (A) provides trust company business (as defined in Article 2(3) of the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998) to another person (B) that is both i) subject to the Sound Business Practice Policy, and ii) carrying on activity within Table 1 or 2 of that Policy, person A must ensure that it has the appropriate level of knowledge, skills and experience to properly fulfil its trust company business activities, taking into account the activities carried on by person B. Compliance with this will be considered as part of the supervisory approach to the trust company business sector.
