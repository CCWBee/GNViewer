## 1 General Guidance

## 1.1 Overview

- 1.1.1 In 2018 the JFSC collected supervisory risk data for reporting entities for the first time. This exercise was repeated in 2019 and, as advised on 30 October 2019 i , the JFSC is collecting the same data in 2020, including wire transfer data from deposit-takers.
- 1.1.2 Understanding the destination of funds transfers and the jurisdictions from which funds are received (funds flow data) is a recognised key indicator of the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing present in a jurisdiction. Where a jurisdiction has a Central Bank, funds flow data is captured and monitored as a matter of course, but as Jersey has no Central Bank, the JFSC is requesting funds flow data from a number of organisations.
- 1.1.3 Any questions that cannot be answered by reading this document should be emailed to your Supervision Manager. For queries relating to the myJFSC portal please email myjfsc@jerseyfsc.org.

## 1.2 Scope

- 1.2.1 If a person is in the business of transmitting or receiving funds by wire or other electronic means, and is doing such business in or from within Jersey, then they are required to register with the JFSC. Registration is required as a result of Article 2(9) of the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 which defines money service business as:
- A person carries on money service business if the person carries on the business of any of the following -
- (a) a bureau de change;
- (b) providing cheque cashing services;
- (c) transmitting or receiving funds by wire or other electronic means;
- (d) engaging in money transmission services.
- 1.2.2 There are 2 exceptions to the registration requirement, one of which is where a person is also registered to carry on deposit-taking business under the Banking Business (Jersey) Law 1991, in which case the person has to notify the JFSC that it is carrying on money service business. The 25 currently registered deposit-takers have made such a notification and are being requested to provide wire transfer data.
- 1.2.3 As the definition of money service business includes 4 specific types of activity, not all those registered to carry on money service business are being requested to provide wire transfer data. Of the 8 persons currently registered, 3 have been requested to provide data.
- 1.2.4 Throughout this guidance document, and the Excel workbook, the 25 deposit-takers and the 3 identified money service businesses are collectively referred to as a Reporting Entity.

## 1.3 Excel workbook

- 1.3.1 The wire transfer data is to be provided to the JFSC through completion of an Excel workbook which contains 3 spreadsheets:
- ZX - Wire Transfer data
- ZY - Outgoing Country List

Guide to Section III of risk based supervision data Wire transfers

- ZZ - Incoming Country List
- 1.3.2 Guidance on completing the spreadsheets is provided in section 2 of this document.

## 1.4 Data reporting period

- 1.4.1 Data should be provided for the period 1/1/2019 to 31/12/2019.

## 1.5 Data submission

- 1.5.1 Reporting Entities are recommended to consider the data request as soon as possible. It may take some time to gather the data requested and the deadline for submission is 17:00 on 31 March 2020 .
- 1.5.2 Each Reporting Entity will be submitting a completed Excel Workbook for Section III wire transfers through the JFSC Portal, and each Reporting Entity has a designated individual who is the JFSC Portal contact, which, in the vast majority of cases, is the compliance officer.
- 1.5.3 Notwithstanding that the JFSC Portal contact has responsibility for submitting the data, the board, or equivalent in a branch scenario (Principal Manager) of the deposit-taking business, should have oversight of the content of the submission made on their behalf.
- 1.5.4 All parts of each question on ZX Wire transfer data should be considered. It is not necessary to insert '0' against each country in spreadsheets ZY-Outgoing Country List and ZZ-Incoming Country List .

ZX3 How many currencies does your entity support ie. make payments or receive funds in? ZX4 With reference to question ZX3. Indicate below the currencies in which you make fund transfers

( Mark with an X all that apply )

## Other, please provide the ISO code of all other currencies ( separated by comma ',')

- 2.4.1 The JFSC is interested to understand the actual currencies in which funds are flowing through the Island as well as the jurisdictions to which payments are being made and funds received from. Consequently, these questions seek data about the underlying currency in which payments and receipts are being undertaken.
- 2.4.2 Question ZX3, please state the total number of currencies in which payments or receipts can be made through a Reporting Entity. Currencies should not be double counted i.e. if payments can be made in USD and funds received in USD then count 1, if funds can be received in AUD but not made in AUD then also count as 1.
- 2.4.3 Question ZX4, includes 10 currencies and a Reporting Entity should mark with an 'X' all those currencies that it supports from a funds transfer perspective.
- 2.4.4 The 10 currencies were identified from the 2017 sample data as being the most common currencies. Where a Reporting Entity receives funds or makes payments in other currencies please identify these using ISO codes in the free text box.
