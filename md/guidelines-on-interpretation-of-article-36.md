## Guidelines on interpretation

## 1 Overview

## General approach

- 1.1.1 The  activities  and  operations  specified  within  the  second  schedule  ( Schedule  2 )  to  the Proceeds  of  Crime  (Jersey)  Law  1999  ( Proceeds of  Crime  Law )  are  broad  ranging.  Those considering whether their activities and operations fall within this broad range of specified activities and operations should adopt an approach that prefers inclusion over exclusion.
- 1.1.2 Where  there  is  doubt, person s  are  encouraged  to  contact  the JFSC to  discuss  their circumstances.

1.1.3

A

person that fails to register as a

Schedule 2

business then carries on unauthorised

Schedule

2  business may  be  found  to  be  in  contravention  of  Article  10  of  the  Proceeds  of  Crime

(Supervisory Bodies) (Jersey) Law 2008 (

Supervisory Bodies Law

) which is an offence carrying liability to imprisonment for a maximum term of 7 years and a fine.

## Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999

- 1.2.1 These guidelines are issued pursuant to Article 36(2) of Proceeds of Crime Law under which the JFSC may issue guidelines on the interpretation of the expression 'when conducted as a business ' or of any provision in Schedule 2 , including any expression used in Schedule 2 .
- 1.2.2 Regard must be given to these guidelines when interpreting the expression 'conducte d as a business', or any expression in Schedule 2 .
- 1.2.3 In interpreting the expression 'conducted as a business', and those used in Schedule 2 , the JFSC has taken account of the meaning given to those expressions in:
- 1.2.3.1 Financial  Action  Task  Force  ( FATF )  International  Standards  on  Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism &amp; Proliferation -the FATF Recommendations as updated from time to time or
- 1.2.3.2 the FATF Methodology  for  Assessing  Technical  Compliance  with  the FATF Recommendations and  Effective  of  AML/CFT/CPF Systems, as updated from time to time.

Together referred to in this document at the FATF Standards .

- 1.2.4 Account must always be taken of the meaning, if any, given to the expression in the FATF Standards .  The FATF  Standards are  not  prescriptive  and  subjective  interpretation  will  be required regarding an assessment of whether and activity or operation is in scope, noting the guidance given in 1.1.1 above.

## Article 36 and Schedule 2

- 1.3.1 Article 36(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Law p rovides that ' Schedule 2 has effect to specify the activities and operations which when conducted as a business constitute financial services business for the purposes of this Law. '

- 1.3.2 This is a high-level filter that determines if an activity or operation is included, or excluded, from the definition of financial services business under the Proceeds of Crime Law .
- 1.3.3 There  are  two  obvious  issues  that  may  arise  when  considering  if  a person 's  activities  or operations are within scope of Article 36(1) and, as such are a financial services business :
- 1.3.3.1 Are they conducting 'activities or operations' specified in Schedule 2 and
- 1.3.3.2 Are those activities 'conducted as a business' ?
- 1.3.4 The two aspects are not wholly separate. There are some activities where acting as a business is almost inherent; and some where it is not. It is difficult to undertake activity that would be recognised as banking and not be a business. However, many people lend money (even at interest) without any suggestion of being in business.
- 1.3.5 The first aspect (1.3.3.1) is considered by reference to Schedule 2 , and supported by Section 3 which features the guidelines on interpretation that the JFSC has issued under Article 36(2).
- 1.3.6 Consideration  of  the  second  aspect  (1.3.3.2)  is  supported  by  Section  2  which  provides guidelines  on  the  consideration  of 'conducted  as  a  business' by  reference  to the  FATF Standards.
- 1.3.7 Except for Non-Professional Trustees ( Schedule 2 , Part 5, Paragraph 25), it is necessary to be conducting the financial services business operations and activities as a business in order for a person 's activities and operations to cause a person to be within scope of Article 36(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Law .

## Registration as a Schedule 2 business with the JFSC

- 1.4.1 Registration as a Schedule 2 business is required, by virtue of the Supervisory Bodies Law , for all person s that meet the criteria at Section 1.3.3. This includes person s that are otherwise provided  exemptions  from  registration  under  the conduct  of  business  and  prudential regulatory Laws (see glossary).
- 1.4.2 If  having  considered  both  aspects  detailed  at  1.3.3  a person concludes  that  they  are,  a financial services business , except if they are a Non-Professional Trustee , they are required to register with the JFSC under the Supervisory Bodies Law , and will become a supervised person , subject to the provisions of Jersey's AML/CFT/CPF regime including the Proceeds of Crime Law 1999, Money Laundering Order ( Money Laundering Order ,  where a supervised person is referred to as a 'relevant person'), and the JFSC 's Handbook for the prevention and detection of money laundering, the countering of terrorist financing and the countering of proliferation financing ( Handbook ).
- 1.4.3 A financial services business that is a Non-Professional Trustee to an Express Trust will not meet the second aspect (1.3.3.2). However, Article 36 and Paragraph 25, within Part 5 of Schedule  2 provide  that Non-Professional  Trustees are financial  services  business for  the purpose of the Proceeds of Crime Law .  As  such, Non-Professional Trustees are  subject  to relevant obligations  under  Jersey's AML/CFT/CPF regime as  modified  by  the  Proceeds of Crime (Duties of Non-Professional Trustees )  (Jersey) Order 2016 ( NPTO ).  Non-Professional Trustees are not required to register with the JFSC .
- 1.4.4 When registering with the JFSC , and on an ongoing basis, a Schedule 2 business must specify all activities and operations that it conducts as a business in order that the JFSC is  able to

maintain an accurate understanding of relevant activities and operations conducted in or from within Jersey. This supports the JFSC in using a risk-based approach in accordance with Article 8A of the Supervisory Bodies Law .

- 1.4.5 A person that is conducting more than one activity or operation within Schedule 2 will need to  consider  if  there  any  different  requirements  that  apply  to  the  relevant  activities  they undertake.

## 2 Guidelines on the interpretation of Conducted as a business

## Conducted as a business

- 2.1.1 Whether or not an activity is conducted as a business can be a qualitative matter, and thus requires an element of subjective judgement. In this regard, neither the FATF Standards , nor Jersey's  laws are  prescriptive.  The JFSC has  long-recognised  that  this  is  an  area  in  which principles-based guidance can be helpful to Industry in respect of conduct of business and prudential  matters.  This  section  provides  guidelines  specifically  in  respect  of Schedule  2 activities and operations.
- 2.1.2 A person conducting activities and operations specified in Schedule 2 will make their own determination regarding whether or not they do so as a business. However, as they carefully consider their circumstances,  they  may  use  the  below  guidelines  to support  their considerations.
- 2.1.3 The guidelines in this Section (2) are not prescriptive on whether an activity or operation is, or is not, conducted as a business. This expression differs from the 'by way of business' test used for conduct and prudential regulation. However, the greater the number of indicators at 2.1.4 that a person meets, the greater the chance that they are conducting activities or operations  as  a  business.  If,  on  balance,  a person remains  unsure  whether  they  are conducting an activity or operation as a business they are encouraged to discuss their specific circumstances with the JFSC .
- 2.1.4 Indicators that a person is conducting an activity or operation as a business include:
- 2.1.4.1 The person holds out or publicly offers to conduct the activity or operation for other person s
- 2.1.4.2 The  activity  or  operation  is  conducted  for  commercial  purposes  with  the intention of earning a profit through receipt of compensation, including nonfinancial benefits/benefits in kind
- 2.1.4.3 The level of financial compensation however received (both in terms of the quantum and as a proportion of the person 's total income) from the activity or operation is significant
- 2.1.4.4 The person conducts more than one type of Schedule 2 activity
- 2.1.4.5 The person conducts  the  activities  or  operations  for  more  than  one  other person

- 2.1.4.6 The person conducting the activity is not doing so in a way where the activity could be fairly described as a hobby or amateur interest or
- 2.1.4.7 The person conducts the activities or operations with a view to making a profit, including where the intention is for the profit to come to someone else such as another group company.
- 2.1.5 The indicators included in paragraph 2.1.4 represent a non-exhaustive list of considerations.
- 2.1.6 If  a person has  judged  themselves  to  be  acting  by  way  of  business  and  is  relying  on  an exemption from having to register under the conduct of business and prudential regulatory laws ,  this may be an indicator they are conducting an activity as a business. For example, lawyers and accountants and other professions and businesses who rely on an exemption from trust company business under the prudential and conduct regulatory laws will need to consider if their trust company business activities are now in scope. However, the relevant indicators for whether or not a person is  conducting a particular activity or operation as a business, may differ depending on the activity or operation being conducted.
- 2.1.7 Indicators that a person is not conducting an activity or operation as a business include, but are not limited to:
- 2.1.7.1 The person does  not  receive  any  form  of  compensation  however  received, financial or otherwise, when conducting the activity or operation; or
- 2.1.7.2 The person conducts the activity or operation in an honorary, recreational or charitable capacity.
- 2.1.8 In addition to the above, when a person is determining whether or not they are conducting an activity or operation as a business, it is relevant for them to consider whether they are doing the activity or operation for or on behalf of a customer (in the context of FI activities and operations) or another person (in the context of VASP s) or providing a service to third parties (in the context of DNFBP s). Further detail on this is included in the following sections.

## Financial Institutions ( FI )

- 2.2.1 FI s are described in Part 2 of Schedule 2 of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999.
- 2.2.2 The FATF Standards define FI ( Schedule 2 , Part 2) as:
- 2.2.2.1 FI means any natural or legal person who conducts as a business one or more of the following activities or operations for or on behalf of a customer […] .
- 2.2.3 Determining  whether  an  activity  or  operation  is  within  the  definition  of FI features  the following three aspects:
- 2.2.3.1 Conducts relevant activities or operations
- 2.2.3.2 Does so 'as a business' and
- 2.2.3.3 Does so for or on behalf of a customer.
- 2.2.4 The first two of these aspects are the same as described at Section 1.3.
- 2.2.5 The third aspect requires that the activity or operation that is conducted as a business needs

to be for or on behalf of a customer. Without the activity or operation being performed for or on behalf of a customer, it would not be considered a FI activity or operation and so would be excluded.

- 2.2.6 ' Customer ' is a broad concept and consideration includes where a person receives, or will receive in the future, any form of compensation however received, financial, or otherwise) for  conducting  an  activity  or  operation  for  or  on  behalf  of  another person .  In  most circumstances (see 2.2.10) that other person would be a customer.
- 2.2.7 However, customer implies someone with whom a person is 'doing business'. If two person s together form a business, they may enter into agreements as to how that business is carried out, and what payments should pass between them. That would not normally be thought of as each carrying on a separate business with the other as a customer; the more natural way of viewing it would be that they are each part of a business. The business that they carry on together would be the one which might have customers. What is important is the substance rather than the form: a customer investing in an investment business of any type will not cease to be a customer for these purposes simply because, as a matter of legal form, they become a  partner  or  a  shareholder.  Similarly,  even  when  a  fund  is  formed  by  a  limited number of people, the pooling of assets is not a 'division of labour within a business', it is the carrying out of the business.
- 2.2.8 Similarly, a person who is an employee of a business does not carry on that business by virtue of being an employee. Where a person enters into employment and carries out activities on behalf of their employer, it is the employer and not the employee, who is conducting the business for and on behalf of a customer. Those customers would be the customers of the employer, and the transactions with those customers would be conducted in the course of the employer's business.
- 2.2.9 Where  an  employer  sets  up  a  scheme  for  its  own  employees  to  give  entitlement  to performance related fees or dividends from t he employer's business as part of remuneration arrangements  for  management  of  its  business  'employee  incentive  arrangements' the employees may not be customers.
- 2.2.10 For FIs only, where there is no customer, then they do not qualify as a financial services business under Section 1.3 even if they firmly fall into the other two aspects referred to above. A person would not be considered to be conducting FI activities or operations for or on behalf of a customer in certain situations, for example:
- 2.2.10.1 A person conducting the activity of trading ( Schedule 2 ,  Part 2, paragraph 8) solely with their own money, and solely on their own behalf, would not be doing so for a customer
- 2.2.10.2 A person conducting an activity or operation ( person 1):
- for another person ( person 2)  that is under the same legal and equitable ownership as person 1  where  the  activities  are  part  of  business  activity under common direction. The test for common ownership is factual and there is no reference to the three-tier test which would be inappropriate to apply  in  these  circumstances.  Also,  different  considerations  may  apply where  such  related  entities  exist  in  different  jurisdictions,  as  this  may weaken common direction; and

- where there are no other person s involved in the conduct of the activity or operation outside of that same legal and equitable ownership; or
- 2.2.11 A person who owns securities, where the person is a company and its sole activity is for itself and its sole owner (e.g. a holding company owned by a fund/pension fund), is not acting for 'other persons' who are customers. Where this entity undertakes other activities, this may mean that this entity is in scope, such as where it is lending or where third-party investors are admitted.
- 2.2.12 The issuance of a company's own shares or bonds will/does not automatically mean that company is a Financial Institution .  An  issuer  of  securities  will only  be  in  scope  if  it  issues securities as a business and does so for or on behalf of its customers (see also 3.12.1). For example, Apple and Google are not considered to be FI 's as they are not, as a business, issuing their shares for a customer.
- 2.2.13 The following flow chart is to assist with considering whether the activities or operations of a person are in scope as an FI activity or operation:

## Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP)

- 2.3.1 The FATF Standards define VASP ( Schedule 2 , Part 4) as:
- 2.3.1.1 Virtual Asset Service Provider means any natural or legal person who is not covered elsewhere under the Recommendations, and as a business conducts one or more of the following activities or operations for or on behalf of another natural or legal person [… ].
- 2.3.2 Determining whether an activity or operation is within the definition of VASP features three aspects:
- 2.3.2.1 Conducts relevant activities or operations
- 2.3.2.2 Does so 'as a business'

- 2.3.2.3 Does so for or on behalf of another natural or legal person.
- 2.3.3 The first two aspects follow the same pattern described at Section 1.3.
- 2.3.4 In addition, the activity or operation that is conducted as a business needs to be for or on behalf of another natural or legal person. Schedule 2 , Part 4, paragraph 25(2) includes where a legal person acts as governing body in relation to legal arrangements within this definition.
- 2.3.5 Without the activity or operation being performed for or on behalf of another person ,  it would not be considered a VASP activity or operation and so would be excluded.
- 2.3.6 ' Another person ' captures a broad range of other parties. If conducting VASP activities or operations  for,  or  on  behalf  of  any  other  parties,  the person would  be  conducting VASP activity.
- 2.3.7 For example, a person undertaking the activity of exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies ( Schedule 2 , Part 4, paragraph 25(2)(a)) solely with their own currency or virtual asset, and solely on their own behalf, would not be doing so for another person .

## Trust and Company Service Providers (TCSP)

- 2.4.1 The FATF Standards define the DNFBP activity of TCSP ( Schedule 2 , Part 3, paragraph 23) as:
- 2.4.1.1 Trust and Company Service Providers refers to all person s or businesses that are  not  covered  elsewhere  under  these  Recommendations,  and which  as  a business, provide any of the following services to third parties […].
- 2.4.2 Determining whether an activity or operation is within the definition of TCSP features three aspects:
- 2.4.2.1 Provides relevant services
- 2.4.2.2 Does so 'as a business' and
- 2.4.2.3 Does so to third parties.

- 2.4.3 The first aspects follow a similar pattern to that described at Section 1.3. However, rather than conducting relevant activities  or operations, a TCSP provides relevant services, as a business.
- 2.4.4 In addition, the activity or operation that is conducted as a business (Article 36) and the TCSP service that is provided ( FATF Standards ) needs to be provided to third parties. Noting that trustee  services  are  always  in  scope  whether  as  a  business  or  not  (i.e. Non-Professional Trustees ).
- 2.4.5 'Third party' is a broad concept in the context of TCSPs and consideration should include similar considerations  for  'customers'  in  the  context  of FI s (see 2.2.5 and  2.2.6). Consideration of the term ' t hird party' should not be limited to person s twice removed from the TCSP (for example, the customer of a customer ). Rather 'third party' should also include:
- 2.4.5.1 a person who has entered into an agreement for the provision of a service to be provided by the TCSP when carrying on a TCSP activity or operation, for

example  providing  TCSP  services  to a settlor, instigator,  promoter,  or investment manager or

- 2.4.5.2 a person who has received or may receive the benefit of services provided or arranged by a TCSP when carrying on a TCSP activity or operation, for example to a limited partner.
- 2.4.6 In relation to a person who is a trustee a third party includes:
- a) a settlor, and a protector, of a trust
- b) a person who, having regard to the risk of the person 's being involved in money laundering, has a beneficial interest in the trust and
- c) is  an object of a power in relation to the trust, and to a person who otherwise exercises control over the trust.
- 2.4.7 This includes where a person receives, or will receive in the future, any form of compensation (financial, or otherwise) for providing TCSP services provided to another person . That other person would, in most cases (see 2.4.8 - 2.4.10) , be a 'third party'.
- 2.4.8 It  is  important  to  draw  a  distinction  between  the  different  business  and  customer relationships that may exist (or not):
- 2.4.8.1 Normally,  a person who  takes  on  the  role  of  a  director  (for  example)  of  a company has no business of their own, and no customer in the ordinary sense of the word. Such a director is no different to any other person who applies for a position and is taken on.
- 2.4.8.2 However, a person may be in the business of providing directorial services. The companies that employ such a person will have a business relationship with the company for or to whom they provide a person to be director. In forming and maintaining that relationship, the company is the customer of the director. The director carrying out the services under that customer relationships may be acting  indistinguishably  from  an  ordinary  director  employed  by  a  single company.
- 2.4.8.3 The company may itself have its own customers. The director may well be the one who is in charge of those customer relationships. But they are not the director's own business and customer relationships.
- 2.4.9 In cases where a person provides a TCSP service to another person and:
- 2.4.9.1 That service is to act as a director or secretary of a company, a partner of a partnership,  or  a  similar  position  in  relation  to  other  legal  persons  or arrangements ( Schedule 2 , Part 3, paragraph 23(2)(b)(i))
- 2.4.9.2 That service is not arranging for another person to act as a director or secretary of a company, a partner of a partnership, or a similar position in relation to other legal persons or arrangements ( Schedule 2 , Part 3, paragraph 23(2)(b)(ii)) and
- 2.4.9.3 The person meets one of the following criteria in respect of that service:

- The person is  a  salaried employee of the company, partnership, or other legal person or arrangement to which they provide the service in addition to their role as a director or secretary of the company, partner of the partnership, or a similar position in relation to another legal person or arrangement or
- The person is  a  salaried  employee  of  a  registered  TCSP  that  also provides the TCSP service of arranging for another person to act as a director or secretary of a company, a partner of a partnership, or a similar position in relation to other legal persons or arrangements to the company.

they would not be providing that TCSP service to a third party.

- 2.4.10 In cases where a person provides a TCSP service ( person 1) to another person ( person 2) and:
- 2.4.10.1 That person 2  is  under  the  same legal and equitable ownership as person 1 where the activities are part of business activity under common direction. The test for common ownership is factual and there is no reference to the threetier test which would be inappropriate to apply in these circumstances. Also, different  considerations  may  apply  where  such  related  entities  exist  in different jurisdictions, as this may weaken common direction
- 2.4.10.2 There  are  no  other person s  in  receipt  of  that  service  outside  of  that  same beneficial ownership and control,

that person would not be providing that TCSP service to a third party.

- 2.4.11 A director who is holding themselves out as providing director services will be conducting a business by doing so (see the indicators at paragraph 2.1.4, above). This means that they will be conducting TCSP as a business. This applies to those who are in the business of hiring themselves out or arranging the provision of people to act as directors. If in that business a person may have one or no directorships at any one time, that person will still be conducting TCSP as business. .
- 2.4.12 Where  a person acts  as  the  director  on  the  board  where  the  role  is  in  an  honorary, recreational or charitable capacity for which they receive no remuneration. e.g. serving on the board of the local bowls club company, serving on the board of a corporate trustee to a charity e.g. a museum, theatre or social project would be out of scope (in the absence of additional 'as a business' indicators).
- 2.4.13 A corporate trustee, which is a company and is acting as a trustee will in the majority of cases be  considered  to  be  acting  as  a  business  and  be  acting  as  a  professional  trustee.  This  is because they will either be conducting their own trade, or be an integral part of the business offering of their wider group, for example:
- 2.4.13.1 A JFSC regulated TCSP administrator agrees terms of engagement to provide a Private Trust Company structure to a family/settlor
- 2.4.13.2 As part of that service the TCSP administrator will provide a legal person to provide  trustee  services  in  relation  to  a  purpose  trust  (earning  fees  for administering the purpose trust)

- 2.4.13.3 The  trustee  of  the  purpose  trust  will  own  a  company  (the  Private  Trust Company) which also provides trustee services in relation to a private family trust
- 2.4.13.4 The  TCSP  administrator  will  provide  corporate  administration  services  (for example, registered office, company secretary and maybe director services) to the Private Trust Company and will be remunerated for providing such services
- 2.4.13.5 the Private Trust Company itself will not be remunerated for acting as trustee and  it  will  not  form  part  of  the  TC SP' s  corporate  structure  or  regulatory affiliation, and the objects of the family trust will not be the same as the objects of the purpose trust.
- 2.4.14 The Private Trust Company may well be acting as part of a business offering. It is set up to be part  of  that  business.  The  fact  that  remuneration  and/or  reimbursement  of  operating expenses may not be received directly by that PTC does not change that conclusion.
- 2.4.15 Similarly, a legal person set up to provide any services under Schedule 2 , Part 3, paragraph 23, will be considered as acting as a business unless it is demonstrated to the contrary.
- 2.4.16 The NPTO was designed to cater for family/private arrangements around wealth management, inheritance, asset protection where the trustees are not receiving fees/remuneration  for  the  trust  and  where  higher  risk  factors  (PEPs,  high  risk  countries, investments) are usually not present. Only in very limited non-professional family/private arrangements are trustees considered to be Non-Professional Trustees and, in those cases, the NPTO will apply. A corporate trustee may have been established in these limited nonprofessional family/private arrangements for ease of administration.

## Other activities and operations

- 2.5.1 It should be noted that the DNFBP activities of casinos, real estate agents, high value dealers, lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants ( Schedule 2 , Part 3,  paragraphs 18 to 22) are not qualified in the same way in the FATF standards ,  i.e.  the performance of these activities or operations will inherently be  conducted as a business, except as outlined in Section 2.6.

## Lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants

- 2.6.1 The Glossary definition for DNFBP s within the FATF Recommendations states:
- 'Lawyers,  notaries,  other  independent  legal  professionals  and  accountants  this  refers  to  sole practitioners, partners or employed professionals within professional firms. It is not meant to refer to 'internal' professionals that are employees of other types of businesses, nor to professionals working for government agencies, who may already be subject to AML/CFT measures.'
- 2.6.2 The JFSC considers that this definition excludes lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants who are not in private practice. In particular, Paragraph 21(2) and 22(2) both state 'It is not meant to refer to 'internal' professionals that are employees of other types of businesses, nor to professionals working for government agencies, who may already be subject to AML/CFT measures.'

## 2.6.3 In circumstances where natural persons:

- 2.6.3.1 Conduct activities and operations meeting the definitions for lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants; but
- 2.6.3.2 Undertake  such  operations  or  activities  in  an  honorary,  recreational  or charitable capacity,

they would be unlikely to meet the second aspect at 1.3.3.

- 2.6.4 However, if the person at  2.6.3.1,  2.6.3.2  is  acting  with  a  view  to  reward  in  the  sense  of compensation  or  benefits  in  kind,  that  would  be  a  powerful  indicator  that  they  are conducting the activity or operation as a business. This includes where the arrangement is for the reward to go not to the person but to some related (in the broad sense) part, e.g. another group company.
- 2.6.5 Where  individuals  within  a  registered Schedule  2  business of  lawyers,  notaries,  other independent legal professionals and accountants are ' partners or employed professionals ' (or their equivalent), provided that:
- 2.6.5.1 The partner or employed professional (or their equivalent) is not conducting activities or operations independent of the Schedule 2 business and
- 2.6.5.2 The JFSC has been appropriately notified of the identity of relevant partners or employed professionals (or their equivalent) who are principal or key persons in  accordance with the provisions of the Supervisory Bodies Law as  per  the required information in the application for registration as a Schedule 2 business which must be updated as required.
- 2.6.6 the JFSC considers  that  each  partner or employed professional (or their equivalent) is an integral  part  of  that  registered Schedule 2  business and  is  not  conducting  the  activity  or operation  of  a  lawyer,  notary,  other  independent  legal  professional,  or  accountant  as  a business in their own right.

## 3 Guidelines on the interpretation of any provision in Schedule 2

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS

## PART 1 - PRELIMINARY

## Interpretation

## 1 Interpretation

In this Schedule -

'fund' means any scheme or arrangement which pools capital raised and operates on the principle of risk spreading; the funds being raised from offers to investors being members of the public, or investors restricted by criteria such as the number of offers, minimum subscription, or the investors' net worth, level of financial sophistication, risk tolerance or other such criteria;

'securities' means any of the following -

- (a) shares, stock, debentures, debenture stock, loan stock or bonds;
- (b) warrants entitling the holders to subscribe for any securities specified in sub-paragraph (a);
- (c) units in a fund;
- (d) life assurance policies;
- (e) other securities of any description;

'virtual asset' means a digital representation of value that can be digitally traded , or transferred and can be used for payment or investment purposes.

## 'Fund'

- 3.2.1 The definition of ' f und' is  intended to be broad-ranging capturing all of the schemes and arrangements commonly used in Jersey and referred to as a 'fund', including, but not limited to:
- 3.2.1.1 Alternative Investment Funds
- 3.2.1.2 Jersey Private Funds
- 3.2.1.3 Legacy Private Funds such as Very Private Funds, Private Placement Funds, and COBO Only Funds
- 3.2.1.4 Recognized funds
- 3.2.1.5 Unclassified funds
- 3.2.1.6 Unregulated funds.
- 3.2.1.7 Non  domiciled  funds  with  a  Jersey  governing  body,  such  as  a  non-Jersey limited partnership with a Jersey general partner.
- 3.2.2 Where an activity or operation meets both the definitions of:
- 3.2.2.1 ' underwriting and placement of life assurance and insurance ' (3.18); and
- 3.2.2.2 'Fund and security services activities' (3.12)

that activity or operation would be underwriting and placement of life assurance and insurance, rather than 'Fund and security services activities'.

## 'Securities'

- 3.3.1 In addition to the definition at Paragraph 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Law ,  the FATF 's Guidance  for  a  Risk-Based  Approach  for  the  Securities  Sector  provides additional  support  for  identifying  activities  or  operations  that  may  fall  within  (e)  of  that definition (other securities of any description):
- 3.3.1.1 ' The term 'securities' is broadly defined for the purpose of this guidance as including, for instance:
- Transferable  securities,  including  equities  and  bonds  or  similar  debt instruments

- Money-market instruments
- Investment funds, including units in collective investment undertakings
- Options, futures, swaps, forward rate agreements and any other derivative contracts relating to securities, currencies, interest rates or yields or other derivatives instruments, financial indices, or financial measures, which may be settled physically or in cash
- Options,  futures,  swaps,  forwards  and  any  other  derivative  contracts relating to commodities that must be settled in cash or may be settled in cash
- Derivative instruments for the transfer of credit risk
- Financial contracts for differences and
- Options, futures, swaps, forward rate agreements and any other derivative contracts relating to climatic variables, freight rates, emission allowances or  inflation  rates  or  other  official  economic  statistics  that  are  settled  in cash,  as  well  as  any  other  derivative  contracts  relating  to  assets,  rights, obligations, indices and measures not otherwise mentioned in this section, which have the characteristics of other derivative financial instruments. '
- 3.3.2 This is further explained with the following note 'The above definition is neither rigid nor exhaustive. Differences exist in legal and regulatory definitions across different jurisdictions and  the  securities  sector  continues  to  evolve  constantly  with  the  introduction  of  new securities products and services.'
- 3.3.3 The general approach to identifying 'securities' is therefore broad by design.

## Legal Arrangements

- 3.4.1 Activities and operations which may be re ferred to as 'conducted by a legal arrangement ' e.g. a trust or limited partnership are in fact and law carried on by the governing body of the legal  arrangement  acting  in  relation  to  the  legal  arrangement  e.g.  the  Trustee(s)  or  the general partner. A trustee will be a financial services business , for example as a TCSP in its own right  and  may  also  be  conducting  activity  that  is  in  scope  of  the  list  of  activities  in Schedule 2 in relation to the trust such as issuing securities or lending.
- 3.4.2 The person acting as governing body in relation to the legal arrangement is responsible for compliance  with  AML/CFT/CPF  obligations  in  relation  to  the  activities  or  operations  it  is conducting in relation to the legal arrangement.

## PART 2 -FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

## Acceptance of deposits and other repayable funds from public

- 2 Acceptance of deposits and other repayable funds from public
- (1) Acceptance of deposits and other repayable funds from the public. This includes private banking.
- (2) Sub-paragraph (1) includes deposit-taking business within the meaning given under Article 3(1), (2) and (3) of the Banking Business (Jersey) Law 1991.
- 3.5.1 The FATF Standards are clear that the FI activity or operation of the Acceptance of deposits and other repayable funds from public also captures private banking.

## Lending

- 3 Lending
- (1) Lending.
- (2) Sub-paragraph (1) includes inter alia: consumer credit, mortgage credit, factoring, with or without recourse; and finance of commercial transactions (including forfeiting).
- 3.6.1 In addition to the general considerations at 2.1 in respect of 'conducted as a business' the JFSC would not consider lending between family members (for example parents lending their children money) to be within the scope of the FATF definition of lending.
- 3.6.2 Where lending is by or to a person that is not a natural person, including where a person is acting  as  governing  body  on  behalf  of  a  legal  arrangement  detailed,  documented consideration should be given as to whether this is lending as a business.
- 3.6.3 Factors  that  generally  indicate  a  lending  arrangement  is  in  scope,  and  these  are  nonexhaustive, including:
- 3.6.3.1 The loan transactions are frequent
- 3.6.3.2 The lending forms part of a commercial transaction
- 3.6.3.3 The loan is on commercial terms with regular repayments culminating in an indicative final date for repayment
- 3.6.3.4 The  lender  takes  security,  involves  a  guarantor  or  has  a  lien  to  ensure repayment of the loan
- 3.6.3.5 Interest is paid to the lender on the loan and
- 3.6.3.6 The lender is making a profit on the loan.
- 3.6.4 Loans between intra group companies/ group companies or connected companies may still be conducting lending as a business depending on the circumstances, noting the indicators above. For example, an intragroup company that is lending on commercial terms to other group companies between legal persons that are connected via common ownership may be as a business. For example, if the issuance of loans is its primary purpose, then it is likely to be lending as a business.
- 3.6.5 A one-off intercompany loan is unlikely to be conducting the business of a lender.

## Financial leasing

## 4 Financial leasing

- (1) Financial Leasing.
- (2) Sub-paragraph (1) does not extend to financial leasing arrangements in relation to consumer products.

## Money or value transfer services

- (2) Sub-paragraph (1) includes money service business within the meaning given under Article 2(9)(b), (c) and (d) of the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998.
- 3.8.1 In addition to the definition at Schedule 2 , Part 2, paragraph 5, the FATF Standards define Money or value transfer services ( MVTS ) as:
- 3.8.1.1 'financial  services  that  involve  the  acceptance  of  cash,  cheques,  other monetary  instruments  or  other  stores  of  value  and  the  payment  of  a corresponding  sum  in  cash  or  other  form  to  a  beneficiary  by  means  of  a communication, message, transfer, or through a clearing network to which the MVTS provider belongs. Transactions performed by such services can involve one  or  more  intermediaries  and  a  final  payment  to  a  third  party  and  may include  any  new  payment  methods.  Sometimes  these  services  have  ties  to particular  geographic  regions  and  are  described  using  a  variety  of  specific terms, including hawala, hundi, and feichen.'
- 3.8.2 MVTS activity is also likely to fall within the definition of Money and currency (3.19).

## Means of payment

## 6 Means of payment

Issuing and managing means of payment (such as credit and debit cards, cheques, traveller's cheques, money orders and bankers' drafts, and electronic money).

## Financial guarantees and commitments

## 7 Financial guarantees and commitments

- (d) transferable securities; or
- (e) futures and options (financial and commodity).
- (2) Sub-paragraph (1) includes investment business within the meaning given under Article 2(2)(a) and (b) of the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998.
- (3) In this paragraph 'trading' includes acting as a principal or agent.

- 3.11.1 In addition to the general considerations of 'conducted as a business' at Section 2.1, and where relevant, whether the person has a 'customer' the JFSC does not consider 'trading' to capture a situation where, for example, a retired person occasionally participates in day trading entirely on their own behalf as a principal (not as an agent for another).

## Fund and security services activities

## 9 Fund and security services activities

- (1) Participation in securities issues and the provision of financial services related to such issues.
- (2) Sub-paragraph (1) includes the following fund and security services activities -
- (a) fund or issuer of securities; and
- (b) service providers to a fund or issuer of securities, including acting as manager, administrator, designated service provider, registrar, investment manager, investment adviser, distributor, subscription agent, redemption agent, premium receiving agent, policy proceeds paying agent, purchase agent, repurchase agent, trustee, custodian, depositary, manager of a managed entity or a member of a partnership (other than a limited partner).

- 3.12.2 Securities issues is a wide term and consideration needs to be given as to entities that may be in scope, for example a trustee of a unit trust that issues units may be considered to be a securities issuer in addition to a trustee.
- 3.12.3 Note the guidance above on asset holding companies.
- 3.12.4 For the avoidance of doubt service providers, providing services in or from within Jersey includes where services are provided to non-domiciled funds.

## Advice on capital structure, industrial strategy etc.

## 10 Advice on capital structure, industrial strategy etc.

The business of providing advice to undertakings on capital structure, industrial strategy and related questions and advice as well as services relating to mergers and the purchase of undertakings.

- 3.13.1 The activity or operation of advice on capital structure, industrial strategy etc will often be conducted by businesses within the  definition of Financial  Institution s,  lawyers,  notaries, other independent legal professionals and accountants ( Schedule 2 , Part 3, paragraphs 2122).
- 3.13.2 The  community  of  service  providers  that  are  not  otherwise  registered  as Schedule  2 businesses and  provide  general  advice  to  other  businesses  on  matters  such  as  project management, compliance with regulations, recruitment, and general policies and procedures are unlikely to determine that their activities fall within Schedule 2 , Part 2, paragraph 10.

## Portfolio management

## 11 Portfolio management

- (1) Individual and collective portfolio management.
- (2) Sub-paragraph (1) includes -

- 3.24.1 Legal professionals employed by public authorities or undertakings which do not provide services to third parties are excluded from the definition.
- 3.24.2 A person is defined as participating in a transaction by assisting in the planning or execution of the transaction, or otherwise acting for or on behalf of a third party in a transaction.
- 3.24.3 Only certain legal activities are set out in Paragraph 21 and in terms of activities included it should be noted that:
- › managing customer money is narrower than handling it; and
- › operating or managing a bank account is wider than simply opening a client account. It would be likely to cover lawyers acting as a trustee, attorney or receiver.
- 3.24.4 As previously stated in the Handbook the Attorney General has confirmed that the following would not generally be regarded as participating in Schedule 2 business :
- › payment on account of costs to a legal professional or payment of a lawyer's bill:

- o in respect of payments on account of costs, law firms should ensure that the payment is proportionate to the issue in respect of which the firm is asked to advise
- o in respect of payment of a lawyer's bill, if payment is made out of criminal property, this would constitute an offence under Article 30 of the Proceeds of Crime Law .
- › Provision of legal advice:
- o in relation to the provision of legal advice, a lawyer needs to consider whether they are providing legal advice or whether they are a lawyer participating in a transaction by assisting in its planning or its execution. Ultimately, each case will have to be decided on its own facts and it is a matter for each firm to form a view
- o however, generally, the giving of generic advice, or advice specific to a transaction in terms of whether such a transaction is possible under Jersey Law or what factors are taken into account in making such a transaction possible, will only constitute the giving of legal advice where the decision has not already been taken to proceed with the transaction
- o where a decision has already been taken to proceed with a transaction, drafting documentation to enable that transaction to proceed, or seeking information to advise further on the planning or execution of the transaction will fall within the scope of the Money Laundering Order.
- › Participation in litigation or a form of alternative dispute resolution:
- o in relation to litigation involving trusts where the proposed resolution includes a change in trusteeship or the application related to asking the Court to approve a future transaction, then the requirements of the Money Laundering Order may apply
- o in respect of advising insolvency practitioners relating to individuals or entities, the requirements of the Money Laundering Order are likely to apply
- o corporate transactions requiring Court approval, such as schemes of arrangement, are likely to be covered by the requirements of the Money Laundering Order .
- › Will writing, although firms should consider whether any accompanying taxation advice is covered:
- o in relation to Will writing, any steps taken during the lifetime of the deponent of the Will to enable their wishes to be given effect to as recorded in the Will, may well fall within definition of Schedule 2 business in which case the requirements of the Money Laundering Order will apply.
- › Publicly funded work:
- o publicly funded work extends to individuals under the legal aid scheme, even if an individual may be required to make a contribution to the fees of the law firm.
- 3.24.5 Lawyers/ law firms may provide other services that will fall within the scope of another part of Schedule 2 . For example, see section 2.6. and consider whether TCSP activities are being conducted for which a registration will be required.

## PART 5 -EXPRESS TRUSTS

## Express trusts

- (1) Except as otherwise provided in this Schedule, acting as trustee of an express trust.
- (2) In subparagraph (1), 'express trust' has the same meaning as is given to that expression by Article 1(1) of the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998.'.
- 3.28.1 A financial services business that is person who is providing services as a Non-Professional Trustee to an Express Trust will not be conducting their activities or operations as a business. See also 1.3.7 and 1.4.3. However, Article 36 and Paragraph 25, within Part 5 of Schedule 2 provide that Non-Professional Trustees are financial services business for the purpose of the Proceeds of Crime Law . As such , Non-Professional Trustees are subject to relevant obligations under Jersey's AML/CFT/CPF regime as modified by the NPTO .
- 3.28.2 Non-Professional Trustees are not required to register with the JFSC under the Supervisory Bodies Law .
- 3.28.3 Whether a person is acting as a business is subject to the same principles as any other activity. A person who  acts  as  a  favour  for  family  or  friends,  or  due  to  some  other person al commitment, and is either unpaid or receives only a token reward, will not be acting as a business and would instead be providing their services as a non-professional trustee. If the responsibilities  increase  and  the  individual  begins  to  be  paid  something  more  like  a commercial reward, then the same person may now be acting as a business, for example:
- 3.28.3.1 Mr Smith agrees to act  personally  as trustee  for  the  Jones  Family  Trust.  In return for the small amount of work and responsibility, the Jones family gift Mr Smith a pair of West End tickets each year. Despite the valuable reward, this is clearly not 'as a business'.
- Mr Smith finds himself working 10 hours per week on trust business. The Jones family agree to pay him his expenses and an hourly rate for his work, which, although lower than Mr Smith would normally charge, is still a commercial rate from which Mr Smith will be able to earn a profit. T his is clearly acting 'as a business'.
