## 1 Overview

## Introduction

- › This document specifies the calculation of the three risk-based Capital Ratios -the three capital ratios for which minima are established in Section 5 of the Banking Code , being the:
- 1.1.1 CET1 capital ratio : the ratio of CET1 capital , as defined in Section 2 , to total risk weighted assets, as defined in Section 5 (total RWAs);
- 1.1.2 Tier 1 capital ratio : the ratio of Tier 1 capital , as defined in Section 3 , to total RWAs ; and
- 1.1.3 total capital ratio : the ratio of total capital , as defined in Section 4 , to total RWAs .
- The Banking Code requires JIBs to internally monitor Capital Ratios daily and notify the JFSC if limits are not complied with or Capital Buffers not maintained. This reporting must be consistent with the definitions set out herein.
- In a small number of identified cases, items are defined purely for the purpose of the prudential return submission. These items are identified where additional information is considered useful to the JFSC , such as a breakdown of the composition of an item.
- The requirements regarding the calculation and reporting of Capital Ratios are based on the international standards promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( Basel Committee ).
- In particular, item numbers have been aligned to the numbering used in the standards, where applicable. In some cases, items in the standard have been omitted as they relate to transitional provisions that are not applicable. Where additional items have been identified as being necessary, the item numbering has been extended beyond that used in the international standard through the use of higher numbers and the addition of letters to enumerate items that are key components.
- The specification sets out both the definitions of the component items and the calculations that must be used to derive the Capital Ratios . Where component items are not relevant to a JIB , the JIB's internal monitoring need not reflect the term.
- The Banking Code also requires JIBs to submit prudential returns to the JFSC , consistently with this document, for each prudential period end date. The specific mechanics of this are set out in the 'Prudential Reporting Guide for JIBs', issued by the JFSC and available at:
- 1.7.1 http://www.jerseyfsc.org/banking-business/prudential-reporting/
- For prudential reporting purposes only, this Guide also specifies the reporting of the Leverage Ratio .

## Layout of this Guide

- Sections 2 to 8 relate to the computation of the Capital Ratios .
- Section 9 relates to the calculation of the Leverage Ratio .
- Appendix A and Appendix B list all items defined herein for, respectively, the prudential reporting of Capital Ratios and the Leverage Ratio .

|      1 | Directly issued qualifying common share capital (and equivalent for non-joint stock  companies) plus related stock surplus . The total of all common share capital plus related  share premium that meet the following qualifying criteria:  1. Represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the  JIB .  2. Entitled to a claim on the residual assets that is proportional with its share of  issued capital, after all senior claims have been repaid in liquidation (i.e. has an  unlimited and variable claim, not a fixed or capped claim).  3. Principal is perpetual and never repaid outside of liquidation (setting aside  discretionary repurchases or other means of effectively reducing capital in a  discretionary manner that is allowable under relevant law).  4. The  JIB  does nothing to create an expectation at issuance that the instrument will  be bought back, redeemed or cancelled nor do the statutory or contractual terms  provide any feature which might give rise to such an expectation.  5. Distributions are paid out of distributable items (retained earnings included). The  level of distributions is not in any way tied or linked to the amount paid in at  issuance and is not subject to a contractual cap (except to the extent that a  JIB  is  unable to pay distributions that exceed the level of distributable items).  6. There are no circumstances under which the distributions are obligatory. Non- payment is therefore not an event of default.  7. Distributions are paid only after all legal and contractual obligations have been  met and payments on more senior capital instruments have been made. This  means that there are no preferential distributions, including in respect of other  elements classified as the highest quality issued capital.  8. It is the issued capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any  losses as they occur. Within the highest quality capital, each instrument absorbs  losses on a going concern basis proportionately and pari-passu with all the others.  9. The paid in amount is recognised as equity capital (i.e. not recognised as a liability)  for determining balance sheet insolvency.  10. The paid in amount is classified as equity under the relevant accounting standards.  11. It is directly issued and paid-in and the  JIB  has not directly or indirectly funded the  purchase of the instrument unless the holding company is itself registered as a  bank. This has the following effect: if the equity is held by a non-bank holding  company, any lending to the holding company by the JIB (directly or indirectly) will  result in an amount equal to that lending becoming ineligible.   12. The paid in amount is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer or  related entity or subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically  enhances the seniority of the claim.  13. It is only issued with the approval of the owners of the issuing  JIB , either given:  › directly by the owners or, if permitted by applicable law, |
|      2 | Retained earnings .

Is perpetual, i.e. there is no maturity date and there are no step-ups or other  incentives to redeem.  5. May be callable at the initiative of the  JIB , but only after a minimum of five years,  provided:  › to exercise a call option, the  JIB  must receive prior  JFSC  approval;   › a  JIB  must not do anything which creates an expectation that the call will  be exercised; and  › JIBs  must not exercise a call unless:  › They replace the called instrument with capital of the same or  better quality and the replacement of this capital is done at  conditions which are sustainable for the income capacity of the  JIB ; or  › The  JIB  demonstrates that its capital position is well above the  minimum capital requirements after the call option is exercised.  6. Any repayment of principal (e.g. through repurchase or redemption) must be with  prior approval from the  JFSC  and  JIBs  should not assume or create market  expectations that approval will be given.  7. Dividend/coupon discretion:  › the JIB must have full discretion at all times to cancel  distributions/payments;  › cancellation of discretionary payments must not be an event of default;  › JIBs  must have full access to cancelled payments to meet obligations as  they fall due; and  › cancellation of distributions/payments must not impose restrictions on the  bank except in relation to distributions to common stockholders.  8. Dividends/coupons must be paid out of distributable items.  9. The instrument cannot have a credit sensitive dividend feature, that is a  dividend/coupon that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the banking  organisation's credit standing. 10. The instrument cannot contribute to liabilities exceeding assets if such a balance  sheet test forms part of national insolvency law.  11. Instruments classified as liabilities for accounting purposes must have principal  loss absorption through either (i) conversion to common shares at an objective  pre-specified trigger point or (ii) a write-down mechanism which allocates losses to  the instrument at a pre-specified trigger point. The write-down must have the  following effects: |

|          | › reduce the amount re-paid when a call is exercised; and  › partially or fully reduce coupon/dividend payments on the instrument.  In addition:  › the trigger level for write-down/conversion of loss absorbing instruments  classified as liabilities must be at least the minimum for  CET1 capital  (4.5%  of  total RWAs );  › the write-down/conversion must generate  CET1 capital  under the relevant  accounting standards and the instrument will only receive recognition in  AT1 capital  up to the minimum level of  CET1 capital  generated by a full  write-down/conversion of the instrument; and  › the aggregate amount to be written-down/converted for all such  instruments on breaching the trigger level must be at least the amount  needed to immediately return the  JIB's CET1 capital ratio  to the minimum  ratio required or, if this is not possible, the full principal value of the  instrument.  12. The terms and conditions must have a provision that enables such instruments, at  the option of the relevant authority, to either be written off or converted into  common equity upon the occurrence of a trigger event, where:  › any compensation paid to the instrument holders as a result of the write- off must be paid immediately in the form of common stock (or its  equivalent in the case of non-joint stock companies);  › the prior authorisation necessary to immediately issue the relevant  number of shares specified in the instrument's terms and conditions  should the trigger event occur; and  › the trigger event is the earlier of: (1) a decision that a write-off, without  which the firm would become non-viable, is necessary, as determined by  the relevant authority; and (2) the decision to make a public sector  injection of capital, or equivalent support, without which the firm would  have become non-viable, as determined by the relevant authority.   13. Neither the  JIB  nor a related party over which it exercises control or significant  influence can have purchased the instrument, nor can it directly or indirectly have  funded the purchase of the instrument. For example, if the instrument is held by a  holding company, any lending to the holding company by the  JIB  (directly or  indirectly) will result in an amount equal to that lending becoming ineligible  (except where the holding company is itself registered as a bank).  14. The instrument cannot have any features that hinder recapitalisation, such as  provisions that require the issuer to compensate investors if a new instrument is  issued at a lower price during a specified time frame.  15. If the instrument is not issued by the  JIB  itself, proceeds must be immediately |

|     46 | Directly issued qualifying Tier 2 instruments plus related stock surplus.  Amounts of  eligible instruments that had been issued by the  JIB  itself.   The eligibility requirements for issued  Tier 2 capital  are:  1. Issued and paid-in.  2. Subordinated to depositors and general creditors of the  JIB .  3. Neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer or related entity or other  arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the claim vis-à- vis depositors and general bank creditors.  4. Maturity:  › minimum original maturity of at least five years;  › recognition in regulatory capital in the remaining five years before  maturity will be amortised on a straight line basis; and  › there are no step-ups or other incentives to redeem.  Where an  instrument's maturity date is less than five years away, the adjusted  value of the instrument is the value multiplied by the remaining residual maturity  (in years) divided by five.  5.

The investor must have no rights to accelerate the repayment of future scheduled  payments (coupon or principal), except in bankruptcy and liquidation.  7. The instrument cannot have a credit sensitive dividend feature, that is a dividend/  coupon that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the banking  organisation's credit standing. 8. Neither the  JIB  nor a related party over which it exercises control or significant  influence can have purchased the instrument, nor can it directly or indirectly have  funded the purchase of the instrument. For example, if the instrument is held by a  holding company, any lending to the holding company by the  JIB  (directly or  indirectly) will result in an amount equal to that lending becoming ineligible  (except where the holding company is itself registered as a bank).  9. If the instrument is not issued by the  JIB  itself, proceeds must be immediately  available without limitation to the bank in a form which meets or exceeds all of the  other criteria for inclusion in  Tier 2 Capital .  10. The terms and conditions must have a provision that enables such instruments, at  the option of the Jersey Resolution Authority, to either be written off or converted  into common equity upon the occurrence of a trigger event, where: |

| 84d    | 1250% risk weighted items: significant investments (non-financial).  Materiality levels are:  › 15% of the  JIB's  total capital for individual investments in commercial entities; and  › 60% of the  JIB's  total capital for the aggregate of such investments,  where the amount subject to this reporting will be that portion of the investment(s) that  exceeds the materiality level.   In the event that both the above apply, compute both excess amounts and only reflect the  higher.   Example 1: if a  JIB  held three investments each representing 25% of its capital (total 75%),  it would determine the excess as being the higher of:  › 3 x (25% - 15%) = 3 x 10% =30%  › (3 x 25%)  -  60% = 75% - 60% = 15%  and hence the relevant amount would be 30% of capital.   Example 2: If it had six such investments, the results would be:  › 6 x (25% - 15%) = 6 x 10% =60%  › (6 x 25%)  -  60% = 150% - 60% = 90%  and hence the relevant amount would be 90% of capital.

| 107  cont. | › Variation margin exchanged is the full amount that would be necessary to fully  extinguish the mark-to-market exposure of the derivative subject to the threshold  and minimum transfer amounts applicable to the counterparty.  › Derivatives transactions and variation margins are covered by a single master  netting agreement ('MNA') between the legal entities that are the counterparties  in the derivatives transaction. The MNA must explicitly stipulate that the  counterparties agree to settle net any payment obligations covered by such a  netting agreement, taking into account any variation margin received or provided  if a credit event occurs involving either counterparty. The MNA must be legally  enforceable and effective in all relevant jurisdictions, including in the event of  default and bankruptcy or insolvency.  If these conditions are met, the cash portion of variation margin received may be used to  reduce the RC reported in Item 104, and the receivables assets from cash variation margin  provided may be deducted from the leverage ratio exposure measure using Item 107 (entering as a negative value), as follows:  › In the case of cash variation margin received, the receiving bank may reduce the  RC (but not the add-on reported) of the exposure amount of the derivative asset  by the amount of cash received if the RC of the derivative contract(s) has not  already been reduced by the same amount of cash variation margin received  under the bank's operative accounting standard. › In the case of cash variation margin provided to a counterparty by the  JIB , the  posting bank may deduct the resulting receivable from its leverage ratio exposure  measure, where the cash variation margin has been recognised as an asset under  the bank's operative accounting framework.  For the avoidance of doubt, cash variation margin may not be used to reduce the Add-on  amount. |
| 108        | Exempted CCP leg of client-cleared trade exposures.  Report certain deductions relating to  the treatment of clearing services. Where a bank acting as clearing member ( CM ) offers  clearing services to clients, the clearing member's trade exposures to the Central  Counterparty ( CCP ) that arise when the clearing member is obligated to reimburse the  client for any losses suffered due to changes in the value of its transactions in the event  that the  CCP  defaults, must be captured by applying the same treatment that applies to  any other type of derivatives transactions. However, if the clearing member, based on the  contractual arrangements with the client, is not obligated to reimburse the client for any  losses suffered due to changes in the value of its transactions in the event that a QCCP  defaults, the clearing member need not recognise the resulting trade exposures to the  QCCP in the leverage ratio exposure measure. Hence it should include the exposure in  Items 104 and 105 but enter an offsetting negative amount in Item 108.  Where a client enters directly into a derivatives transaction with the  CCP  and the  CM guarantees the performance of its clients' derivative trade exposures to the  CCP , the bank  acting as the clearing member for the client to the  CCP  must calculate its related leverage  ratio exposure resulting from the guarantee as a derivative exposure, as if it had entered  directly into the transaction with the client, including with regard to the receipt or  provision of cash variation margin, and include the amounts within Items 104 to 107.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
