## 1 General guidance

## 1.1 Scope

- i. In 2018, the JFSC collected supervisory risk data for reporting entities for the first time. This exercise was repeated in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.
- 1.1.1 This guidance document relates to the Excel workbook Section II of the 2022 risk based supervision data collection which requires the provision of data in respect of Public Funds.
- 1.1.2 A Public Fund is a Financial Services Business as specified in Schedule 2, Part A, paragraph 3 of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 ( POC ) and is subject to the requirements of the Money Laundering (Jersey) Order 2008 ( MLO ).
- 1.1.3 Data should be provided on the Public Fund where the Public Fund meets the definition of 'Collective Investment Fund' as set out in Article 3 of the Collective Investment Funds (Jersey) Law 1988, as amended. Public Funds are all Jersey Public Funds (Certified, Recognized and Unregulated) and Non-Jersey Public Funds that are managed and controlled from Jersey. For the purposes of collating the list of Non-Jersey Public Funds only those that have FSBs providing the following services have been listed:
- (a) Manager;
- (b) Investment Manager;
- (c) General Partner; and
- (d) Trustee.
- 1.1.4 Public Funds that are relevant persons are required to have an MLCO and an MLRO under the MLO.
- 1.1.5 The Public Fund as a relevant person should have obtained Customer Due Diligence ( CDD ) on all its investors (its customers), their beneficial owners and controllers, and on any third parties upon whose behalf the investor acts and the beneficial owners and controllers of those third parties.
- 1.1.6 The JFSC is required to supervise the Public Funds compliance with AML/CFT/CPF requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Supervisory Bodies) (Jersey) Law 2008 ( SBL ).

## 1.2 Data collected

- 1.2.1 Funds are largely excluded from the Section 1 data collection exercise, however as the JFSC is required to supervise Public Funds the JFSC requires data so that it can continue to risk profile the Public Funds /FSBs.
- 1.2.2 Consequently, data is again being requested on the customers (investors) of the Public Funds.

## 1.3 Excel workbook

- 1.3.1 The Excel workbook that the Fund Services Business (FSB) completes in relation to each of the Public Funds that it acts for (using one line for each Public Fund) comprises 11 spreadsheets, as follows:

Public Funds

- (a) ZA1: Fund Compliance Data
- (b) ZA2: Asset Compliance Data
- (c) ZA3: Investor Data
- (d) ZA4: Beneficial Owner, Controller and Third Party Data
- (e) ZA5: Fund Concessions Data

Country response spreadsheets for specific questions

- (f) ZA3(a) Countries of Investors
- (g) ZA3(g) Countries of PEPs
- (h) ZA4(a) Countries of Beneficial Owners and Controllers of Investors, where the investor is not an individual
- (i) ZA4(b) Countries of Third Parties on whose behalf the investor acts

For information

- (j) ZA6: Freetext Explanations
- (k) List of Questions
- 1.3.2 The JFSC recognises that printing each spreadsheet to determine the data requirements is not possible due to the construct of the document, therefore the last spreadsheet in the Excel workbook contains a list of the questions for printing.
- 1.3.3 Some of the questions are only being asked of the Non-Jersey Public Funds as we already hold the data on Jersey Public Funds.

## 1.4 Public Fund customers of the FSB

- 1.4.1 Historically the JFSC has had data available in relation to Jersey Public Funds, in particular via the application process, filing of personal questionnaires and quarterly statistics returns. The JFSC records the name of every key person of the Jersey Public Funds. To collate the list of Jersey Public Funds per FSB, the JFSC has identified the MLCO for each fund and linked them to the relevant FSB (note where the FSB is a managed entity, the MoME has been allocated the Jersey Public Fund).
- 1.4.2 In some cases where an MLCO is employed by a group, the fund listed for which the FSB is to provide data for may not be a fund that the FSB acts for directly. This is because in some cases we have collated the list of funds by reference to the MLCO. In some scenarios the MLCO acts on behalf of more than one group member. In these circumstances we ask that the FSB who has been sent the Excel workbook provide the responses liaising with the other FSB group member and indicates in Section ZA6 the name of the Public Fund and that the answers have been provided after liaison with the named FSB group member.
- 1.4.3 In relation to Non-Jersey Public Funds, information is held via the application process and the quarterly statistics, but no personal questionnaires are filed for the key persons. Therefore in collating the list of Non-Jersey Public Funds, the JFSC has done this by the service provided by a particular FSB. In this case the services of Manager, Investment Manager, General Partner and Trustee have been used.
- 1.4.4 The JFSC expects the FSB providing services to the Public Funds to have conducted a customer risk assessment on the Public Fund. The JFSC would expect the FSB as a minimum to be able to complete sections ZA1 and ZA2.

- 1.4.5 If the FSB:
- (a) provides the MLCO of the Public Fund; and/or
- (b) is delegated the responsibility to collate CDD on the Public Funds investors,
- the JFSC would expect the FSB to be able to complete the whole of the Public Funds workbook.
- 1.4.6 If there is another Jersey FSB that provides the services listed in 1.4.5 then please contact the JFSC by no later than 1 March 2023 providing alternative contact details for this FSB. Each Public Fund has only been listed once in a workbook for one FSB therefore, unless the JFSC is told that there is another Jersey FSB who should be providing the information requested, then the FSB who has the Public Fund named in its workbook will need to provide the information.
- 1.4.7 If there is no other Jersey FSB (or no alternative contact is provided by 1 March 2023) then the JFSC requests the FSB to liaise with each of the Public Funds it acts for to provide the information in the Public Funds workbook. In the event that the FSB is not able to provide any part of the data requested in relation to the Public Fund, then an explanation will need to be provided.
- 1.4.8 This data collection for ZA3 to ZA5 is on the customers of the Public Fund i.e. its investors and their beneficial owners and controllers, and third parties for whom the investors in the Public Fund act.

## 1.5 Data reporting period

- 1.5.1 The Section II data reporting period is 1/1/2022 to 31/12/2022.
- 1.5.2 Generally, the data should be provided as at the end of the reporting period (31/12/2022 or closest business day) unless otherwise specified.

## 1.6 Data submission

- 1.6.1 Whilst the JFSC will be collecting the same data as it did in previous years, FSBs are still recommended to consider the data request as soon as possible. It may take some time to gather the data requested and the deadline for submission is 17:00 on 30 April 2023 .
- 1.6.2 Each FSB will receive an email sent to their JFSC Portal contact indicating that there are documents available for download through the JFSC portal.
- 1.6.3 The JFSC Portal contact will be able to download the Public Funds Excel workbook which will be populated with the names of the Public Funds that the JFSC's records show the FSB provides services to.
- 1.6.4 Once the Public Funds Excel workbook has been downloaded from the website it can be forwarded to the relevant persons within the FSB for completion. However, please note that only one consolidated completed Public Funds Excel workbook per FSB should be submitted through the JFSC Portal by the JFSC Portal contact.
- 1.6.5 Notwithstanding who has responsibility for submitting the data, the governing body of the FSB and the governing body of the Public Fund should have oversight of the content of the submission made on their behalf.
- 1.6.6 With the exception of spreadsheet ZA6- Freetext Explanations , all parts of each question should be answered. Consequently, where there is a nil return, insert a '0' where relevant, in each row.

- 1.6.7 Where responses to any questions require further explanation please provide this on the spreadsheet ZA6- Freetext Explanations .
- 1.6.8 No answers are expected for Public Funds that are in liquidation, liquidated, terminating or terminated or where the FSB has ceased to act (subject to 1.4.6 and 1.4.7 above). However, for the purposes of the questionnaire, please use ZA6: Freetext explanations - identifying the Public Fund and providing an explanation in relation to the relevant fund of why no answers are being provided i.e. terminated / liquidated / ceased to act.

## 1.7 Integrity checking your submission

- 1.7.1 For each Public Fund, the following should all add to the same total number, as the questions analyse the total number of investors:
- (a) Type of investors: sum of ZA3(b)(i) to (iii)
- (b) By risk category: sum of ZA3(c)(i)(i) to (iii)
- (c) Split between retail and institutional/professional: ZA3(d)(i) + (ii).

| ZA1(b)                           | Principal Jurisdiction of Promoter / Instigator of the Fund: Select one country from dropdown provided  This question is seeking the principal jurisdiction of the entity that is the  driving force behind the fund. This might be the Investment Manager,  Distributor or one key individual etc. Factors that may indicate an entity is  the Promoter / Instigator may include: 1. The name of the fund is linked to the entity. 2. If the entity had withdrawn from the initial proposal, the fund would  not have gone ahead (unlike an administrator that can be replaced). 3. The majority of investors are being put into the fund by the entity. 4. The entity is responsible for the instructions to set up the fund. 5. The fund is the 'brainchild' of the entity. 6. The entity is providing the initial directors to the Public Fund's  governing body. 7. The entity owns the management shares/otherwise has control of  the governing body of the fund. 8. The entity is financing the initial set up of the fund (which it may or  may not get back). 9. The entity has devised the investment advice, investment policy and  investment strategy of the fund. 10. The entity gets a performance fee rather than a fixed fee.

| ZA1(e)             | Does the fund accept cash (coins and notes)? Select yes or no from the drop down This question is intended to determine the extent to which physical cash is  still used in the funds sector. This does not include bank transfers, cheques  or any form of virtual currency transactions. Whilst we recognise that the use of cash is minimal in the Jersey-based  funds sector, it is important that this assumption is validated as cash  transactions are a key risk indicator for money laundering and the  financing of terrorism. |

Question  ZA3(c)(i)  requests data about the number of investors that have  been assessed as presenting a higher, standard or lower ML/TF risk (on the  basis of factors set out in sections 3.3.4 and 14.2.3 of the AML/CFT/CPF  Handbook).  Where use is made of a more precise risk scoring scale, it will be necessary  to determine which categories in that scale approximate to higher v , standard  or lower risk. For example, if a Public Fund measures risk on a score of 1 to  10, it may consider anything between 1 and 3 to present a lower risk, 4 to 7  to present a standard risk, and 8 to 10 to present a higher risk. |

For example, an individual living and working in Jersey is unlikely to be regulated for AML/CFT/CPF unless they are a relevant person such as: (i) a lawyer/accountant (a financial services business as described in Schedule 2, Part B of the POC); or (ii) a Class G director (a holder of a Trust Company Business class of financial service business issued under the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998).

## ZA3(f)

## Number of investors and their beneficial owners and controllers where enhanced CDD measures have been applied:

This question is designed to get a general feel for the extent to which enhanced CDD is obtained in relation to investors.

This question requires the total number of investors and their beneficial owners and controllers who have had enhanced CDD measures applied during 2022 for any of the specific reasons listed in Section 7 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook or as a result of the application of an entity CDD policy.

In addition to a Public Fund deciding that an investor presents a higher risk of money laundering or financing terrorism, there are some circumstances, set out in Articles 15 and 15A of the Money Laundering Order, where enhanced CDD measures are required. See also section 7 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook which details scenarios where enhanced CDD must be applied .

The following scenarios are considered most relevant for a Public Fund:

- a) the investor is, or some other prescribed person is, a politically exposed person (PEP) (section 7.6)
- b) the investor has a 'relevant connection' to an 'enhanced risk state' (section 7.5)
- c) the investor is a company with nominee shareholders or issues bearer shares (section 7.10)
- d) the investor is a personal asset holding vehicle (section 7.9)
- e) the investor, or one or more beneficial owners/controllers of the investor, is not physically present for identification purpose (section 7.4) or
- f) the investor is a non-Jersey resident (section 7.7)

For example every individual investor in a Public Fund who is not a Jersey resident individual will need to have enhanced CDD applied to them . Under Article 15(1)(a) of the MLO, if a customer has, or proposes to have, a business relationship or proposes to carry out a one-off transaction with the relevant person and the relevant person is not resident in the customer's country of residence or in the same country as the country from which, or from within which, the customer is carrying on business, a relevant person

must apply enhanced customer due diligence measures on a risk-sensitive basis.

Where the investor is not an individual but for example a company or a limited partnership, then not only the jurisdiction of the company/limited partnership will need to be considered, but so will its beneficial owners and controllers.

For example: if you have a Jersey company which is controlled by its board of 3 directors, 2 are Jersey resident and 1 is UK resident, then enhanced CDD will be applied to that 1 UK resident director, so the Jersey company/limited partnership will need to be reported as 1 investor who has had enhanced CDD applied.

We understand, from our work with the NRA working group industry representatives, that some Reporting Entities have incorporated the EDD measures that are required for non-Jersey-based customers into their standard customer take-on processes. However, this question seeks information against the requirements of the MLO, therefore if there is a significant difference between the number of customers who have enhanced due diligence applied to them and the number of non- Jerseybased customers, then please be ready to explain the difference.

Questions ZA3(g) to ZA3(i) request data on 3 particular reasons for enhanced CDD being applied.

## Total number and jurisdiction of PEPs who are, or are connected with investors (including via beneficial owners and controllers). Answer this question on Country Tab ZA3(g)

Each of the Public Funds are listed vertically in column A and there is a choice of countries listed horizontally. Input the number of Politically Exposed Persons ( PEPs ) in each country per fund. If there are none leave the entry as '0'.

This question requires the number of investors to which enhanced CDD measures have been applied due to a PEP connection.

On 12 June 2019 the Money Laundering Order was amended (see Article 15A of the Money Laundering Order and Section 7.6.2 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook). From this date enhanced CDD measures became mandatory for the following:

- a) a domestic politically exposed person only where a high-risk business relationship or high-risk one-off transaction is involved ( domestic PEP );
- b) a foreign politically exposed person ( foreign PEP );
- c) a prominent person;

When considering whether an investor is connected with a domestic PEP or  foreign PEP, it must be remembered that the definition of a PEP includes  close associates and immediate family members of any individual. Close  associate and immediate family member are both defined in Article 15A(3)  of the Money Laundering Order.  The information to be considered when deciding if an investor is a close  associate of a domestic PEP or foreign PEP is limited to information in the  possession of the Public Fund or information that is publicly known  (Article 15A(4) of the Money Laundering Order). PEPs should be reported under the country (or countries) which give rise to  their PEP status. For example, in a case where an individual is entrusted with  a public function in country A and the close family member of that foreign  PEP resides in country B, both PEPs should be reported under country A. |

Answer this question on Country Tab ZA4(b) Each of the Public Funds are listed vertically in column A and there is a  choice of countries listed horizontally. Input the number of third parties for  whom investors are acting for by principal country of residence per fund. If  there are none leave the entry as '0'. For example, a legal arrangement cannot form a business relationship or  carry out a one-off transaction itself. It is the trustee(s) of the trust or  general partner(s) of the limited partnership who will enter into a business  relationship or carry out the one-off transaction with a Public Fund on behalf  of the legal arrangement and who will be considered to be the investor(s). In  line with Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order, the trust or limited  partnership will be considered to be the third party on whose behalf the  trustee(s) or general partner(s) act(s).  In these cases the Public Fund should have identified the persons for whom  the investor is acting in line with Article 3(2) of the Money Laundering Order.  In a case where a third party is a collective investment fund, data should be  provided on any beneficial owners and controllers, i.e. individuals exercising  control of the collective investment fund through ownership means, other  means or through the position that they hold (see section 13 of the  AML/CFT/CPF Handbook which specifically addresses Funds and Fund  Operators). |

| ZA5(a)                       | Total number of individuals/entities to whom concessions have  been applied who are investors or connected to investors in the  Public Funds (including via beneficial owners and controllers or as  third parties for whom the investor acts). The JFSC is seeking to understand the frequency of the use of concessions.  Consequently, this question is designed to elicit the total number of  concessions applied to investors by the Public Fund. It is acknowledged that  more than one concession may be utilised for the same investor. The response to this question should equal the sum of ZA5(d)(i) to (ix).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ZA5(b)                       | Number of investors, as at the end of the data reporting period,  where identity has not yet been verified as the relationship started  before February 2008 and Article 13(2) of the MLO is being relied  upon. Article 13(2) of the Money Laundering Order provides for the timing of  identification measures for the existing investors of a Public Fund at the time  the Money Laundering Order came into force - 4 February 2008.  Article 13(2) sets out very particular circumstances which enabled a Public  Fund to delay verification of an investor's identity - section 4.7.2 of the  AML/CFT/CPF Handbook provides further guidance. A Public Fund should have finalised the position of its existing investors by  31 December 2014, unless a later date has been agreed by the JFSC  (paragraphs 260 of section 4.7 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook).  Consequently, it is expected that most Public Funds will report '0' in respect  of  ZA5(b) . |

## Exemptions from applying third party identification requirementsArticles 17B-D

In line with Articles17B-D of the Money Laundering Order, a Public Fund may apply CDD exemptions and not find out the identity of a third party on whose behalf a customer acts or obtain evidence of identity. The application of the exemption is dependent upon the status of the customer and in some circumstances the Public Fund.

The Public Fund may apply exemptions from applying third party identification requirement in 4 circumstances if the Public Fund has reasonable grounds for believing that its investor is:

- a) regulated and supervised by the JFSC for AML/CFT/CPF purposes;
- b) a person who carries on equivalent business (refer to Section 1.8 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook); or
- c) a person who is wholly-owned by a person listed above and meets certain conditions.

The application of exemptions from third party identification measures is also always subject to one or more conditions (depending on the particular case). In practice, these provisions have the effect of:

- a) limiting the number of investors to which exemptions can be applied; and
- b) requiring the basis for applying exemptions to be recorded in writing.

## The four circumstances are:

- a) Article 17B(1): customer/or parent of customer is a JFSC regulated (or equivalent business) deposit-taker, fund, insurer, investment business or fund services business
- b) Articles 17C(1)(a) and 17C(1)(b): customer is or carries on business in respect of an Unregulated Fund or non-public fund (or equivalent business)
- c) Article 17C(1)(c)(i): where the relevant person is a deposit-taker and investor is a TCB (or equivalent business)
- d) Article 17C(1)(d): where the relevant person is a deposit-taker and investor is a lawyer (or equivalent business)

This question is seeking the number of investors where third parties who it acts for have not been identified pursuant to Articles 17B-D. For example 1 regulated bank (the investor) acts on behalf of 10 clients. The number of investors to whom this concession relates is 1 and should be reported as 1.

## Further CDD exemptions - Article 18

Article 18 of the Money Laundering Order sets out a number of very specific circumstances where a Public Fund may be able to apply further CDD

exemptions to its investors. Not all of these CDD exemptions have the same effect. Investors to whom CDD exemptions have been applied could include:

- a) Article 18(2) - pension, superannuation, employee benefit, share option or similar scheme
- b) Article 18(1) - insurance policies
- c) Article 18(4) - public authorities, companies listed on an IOSCO-compliant market or regulated market
- d) Article 8(3) - regulated businesses or equivalent
- e) Article 18(5)- employees of regulated businesses or equivalent

This question is seeking the number of investors to whom CDD exemptions have been applied pursuant to Article 18.
