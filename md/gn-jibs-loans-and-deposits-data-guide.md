## 1 '8.1 Asset Quality &amp; Provisions'

## Summary of specific and general provisions and of loan quality

- 1.1 This sheet is intended to provide an overview of the JIB's provisions and the underlying credit quality of its loans and advances.
- 1.2 The quality of loans and advances must be segmented by the bank to provide:
- 1.2.1 An analysis of non-performing loans according to number of days past due; and
- 1.2.2 A segmentation based on the bank's own classification of its loans and advances.
- 1.3 It is expected that the total amount of loans classified as 'substandard' or 'default' will be consistent with the figure reported for 'Gross loans provided against' and that both figures will be correlated with those for past due loans, particularly those relating to loans classified as more than 90 days past due. Where figures appear to be materially inconsistent, an explanation should be provided in the covering letter.

## 4 '8.4 Lending by Sector'

## Lending by sector and type

- 4.1 The sector analysis report requires a breakdown between the columns 'Local' and 'Non Local'. If residence is uncertain, all customers that provide a Jersey address should be classed as 'Local' unless either:
- 4.1.1 The address is that of a Jersey financial intermediary and the beneficial owner's residence is unknown; or
- 4.1.2 The customer is not believed to be resident in Jersey,
- in which case treat as 'Non Local'.
- 4.2 Items A.1 to A.10 should be completed with a breakdown of the JIB's loans and advances by sector.
- 4.3 Items B.1 and B.2 should be completed with an analysis of the JIB's loans and advances allocated between 'Overdrafts' and all 'Other Loans &amp; Advances'.
- 4.4 Items A and B are the respective sums from the data entered above. As such they should total the same amount, and each should equate to the total reported in sheet  '2.1 Balance Sheet Assets' for Item 'D.0: Loans and Advances Total'.

## 5 '8.5 Large Exposures'

Schedule of Large Exposures, identifying those approved by the JFSC, excluding types for which no specific approval is required.

- 5.1 All JIBs are required to provide a statement of all Large Exposures, being those in excess of 10% of agreed capital resources ( ACR ).
- 5.2 This requirement includes any such exposures in excess of 25% of ACR. Such an exposure is referred to as an LE25 and Article 11 of the Banking Business (General Provisions) (Jersey) Order 2002 stipulates that a registered person must not enter into an LE25 without the JFSC's approval.
- 5.3 A full description of the JFSC's requirements in respect of Large Exposures, including the relevant definitions, is provided within Section 5.4 and Appendices II and III of the Codes of Practice for Deposit-taking Business ( Code ).
- 5.4 Appendix II provides full definitions. Briefly, Large Exposures include both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items and, to calculate them, it is first necessary to aggregate individual exposures that are connected or associated.
- 5.5 In the case of a Large Exposure approved as a Concession Limit (see Codes for definition), this must include guarantees provided by the counterparty where those guarantees have been used as the basis for the LE25 approval.
- 5.6 LE25s covered by the Money Market Concession (see Codes for definition) are permitted, subject to post event notification requirements, and hence do not require specific approval in advance. These, together with Large Exposures below 25% of ACR to similar counterparties (i.e. those which would fall within the Money Market Concession if they exceeded 25% of ACR), should be reported within the 'Exempt Large Exposures' sheet (see Section 6), rather than being reported here.
- 5.7 All other Large Exposures must be reported here, including:
- 5.7.1 LE25s to counterparties for which a Concession Limit has been approved;
- 5.7.2 LE25s approved in connection with a parental guarantee;
- 5.7.3 LE25s approved in connection with a guarantee from a counterparty for which a Concession Limit has been approved;
- 5.7.4 LE25s approved based on collateral arrangements (cash and near cash only);
- 5.7.5 LE25s receiving 'out-of-policy' approval;
- 5.7.6 LE25s that have not been approved; and
- 5.7.7 Large Exposures falling between 10% and 25% of capital for which specific approval is not required (except those referred to in 5.6).
- 5.8 Exposures to group, other than to parent, are treated identically to non-group exposures, save that group exposures should be declared as related exposures by entering 'Y' in the 'Connected?' column.
