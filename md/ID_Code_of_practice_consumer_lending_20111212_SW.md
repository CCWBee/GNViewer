
## Borrowing Money? A Code of Practice for Consumer Lending

Sponsored by the Jersey Consumer Council and supported by the Citizens Advice Bureau Jersey Financial Services Commission Jersey Trading Standards Service Jersey Bankers Association Lending organisations and related bodies

## Foreword

In  December  2005  the  Jersey  Financial  Services  Commission  (JFSC)  organised a  meeting  of  representatives  of  local  financial  institutions,  Trading  Standards Service,  Citizens  Advice  Bureau  and  the  Jersey  Consumer  Council  with  the objective  of  drafting  a 'cross-  industry,  voluntary  code  of  practice  in  order  to improve the consumer lending environment' .

The JFSC regulates deposit-takers under the Banking Business (Jersey) Law 1991, its  oversight  of  regulated entities extending to all activities, including lending. However,  there  is  very  little  consumer  protection  for  borrowing  from  Jersey lenders as we have no equivalent of the UK Consumer Credit Act.

The Consumer Lending Steering Group was formed from the original attendees of the December meeting and joined over the coming year by other interested parties. By June of 2007 the Group had agreed the basic wording of a code of practice and a 'user friendly' version was then produced.

This code has the support of the majority of Jersey lenders and sets standards of good lending practice so that individuals can enter into borrowing agreements with their eyes open, aware of the facts, conscious of their responsibilities and, most importantly, aware of the true costs.

On behalf of the Steering Group I commend the code to you.

## The Code

This is a voluntary code of practice with the key aims of:

- · enabling Jersey consumers to be fully aware of, and understand, the terms under which they are borrowing money;
- · enabling Jersey lenders, brokers and financial advisers to obtain the right information to ensure that credit is not advanced where the ability to meet repayment might be in doubt; and
- · promoting responsible lending.

The  Code sets  standards  of  good  lending  practice,  which  are  followed  as  a minimum by those institutions subscribing to it. These standards seek to ensure that Jersey consumers are treated fairly and that the opportunities for taking on excessive financial commitments are reduced.

Subscribers are listed on page 6. If you are considering borrowing from a nonsubscriber  to  this  code,  it  is  suggested  that  you  may  wish  to  obtain  similar information.

## Scope

The  Code  applies  to  formally  agreed  lending  to  Jersey  consumers,  which includes personal loans, mortgages, hire purchase agreements and overdrafts. The subscriberswillalsoapplytheCode'sstandardstolendingarrangedviathirdparties, whether those parties are subscribers or not. The Code does not apply to business borrowing nor does it apply where the sum to be borrowed is £500 or less.

## Our commitment to you

We will always inform you of, and explain, key information when providing you with credit facilities or a written quotation so you have all the facts needed to make a properly informed choice. This will always include:

Amount

the full amount you will be borrowing. for  how  long  you  will  be  borrowing  and  how  this  could change.

Term

1

Repayment

the total amount you will repay including interest and any other charges.

Repayments

the number of repayments you will make, how often and how these could change.

Interest rate

the actual interest rate being charged and, if this is not fixed, how it is worked out.

Interest charge

the  total  amount  of  interest  charged  and,  if  it  is  changed, how and why.

Fees and charges

all non-interest charges payable and, if not fixed, how they can be incurred.

Cancellation early repayment

or your rights to cancel the agreement or repay a loan earlier than planned and any charges that might be applied as a result.

Insurance costs

any proposed additional cost for taking insurance cover will be shown separately.

Insurance disclosures

before you take out payment protection insurance, we will help you decide if the policy suits you by giving you:

- • the name of the insurer;

- • what you will be covered for;

- • the total cost;

- • key benefits;

- • cancellation rights and costs;

- • any exclusions;

- • how to make a claim; and

- • who to contact.

Joint account holders and guarantors

if you have a joint account, or enter into a liability with another person, we will tell you your individual rights and responsibilities.

If you are not provided with any of the above, please ask.

## Marketing and Annual Percentage Rate (APR)

In all forms of advertising and marketing material where repayments are quoted, we will show clearly a typical Annual Percentage Rate (APR). We will also clearly indicate in all lending related advertising issued in Jersey that we abide by the Code of Practice for Consumer Lending.

Upon request, the APR for a particular credit facility will always be given to you, together with the other information detailed above. In addition to the interest payable, the APR will also take into account other related charges to be added to  the  initial  debt.  Certain  charges  paid  separately  (that  are  not  added  to  the initial debt) will not be included in the APR calculation. APR is a useful tool for comparing the cost of credit but you should consider all aspects of the credit facility, including costs excluded in the APR, and the total amount repayable over the life of the loan, before choosing the right one for you.

## Other key commitments to you

We will act fairly, reasonably and responsibly in all our dealings with you and help you when you need information and guidance.

We will provide written terms and conditions of your borrowing agreement and any other appropriate information on aspects of your indebtedness to us. These will set out your rights and responsibilities clearly and in plain language.

We will make sure that all advertising and promotional material is clear, fair and does not mislead and, as responsible lenders/advisors, we will make sure that all applications are soundly and properly assessed.

## Complaints procedure

We take complaints seriously and have established procedures for dealing with them fairly, speedily and constructively. If you complain, you will be told straight away what these procedures are. If your complaint directly relates to compliance with this Code then you may take such an issue to the Trading Standards Service which may investigate complaints relating to this Code.

## Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs)

A CRA is an organisation that holds personal credit records. Most financial lenders, and all subscribers to this Code, provide regularly updated information to CRAs. When you apply for an account we will tell you that we may use a CRA to research your credit history. These searches will be recorded.

You will also be told that we plan to tell CRAs that you have an account with us and how you run that account. We and other lenders may use that information to assess future applications and to prevent or detect fraud or money laundering and/or to trace debtors.

You should be aware that if you do not meet the obligations of any agreement, the availability of this information to other lenders may have a serious effect on your ability to obtain credit in the future.

You have the right to apply to the CRAs for details of what information is held about you and to query such data if you believe it is incorrect.

## Guarantees and security

Where we take guarantees or other forms of security, we will notify the guarantors /  security providers at a reasonably early stage if there is a likelihood of claims being made upon them.

Where your home is required as security for the lending, we will ensure that you are aware that it will be at risk if you are not able to repay the loan.

## Your commitment to us

We are committed to acting in a responsible manner. We do not wish to place any customer in a position that is likely to cause financial difficulty. Your application will  receive  a  proper  and  sound  credit  assessment  which  may  require  you  to provide certain information about you and your financial affairs.

## You may need to provide details of:

- · all other loans or borrowings that you already have;
- · all  other  regular  and  known  financial  commitments e.g.  rent,  mortgage repayments and maintenance obligations; and
- · total monthly income (identifying what you are certain of receiving and any  variables  e.g.  overtime  or  commission)  and  committed  /  necessary expenditure.

This will help us to identify the income you have available to service the proposed borrowing. When providing this information, you should ensure that you do not underestimate your outgoings and allow enough for emergencies. You must not conceal any facts that may materially affect your application. An example budget planner for recording this information is provided herein and is also available on the States of Jersey web site shown on page 7.

## Financial hardship

You  should tell  us  straight  away  if  your  financial  circumstances  change,  so affecting your ability to repay any of your financial obligations.

We will consider cases of financial difficulty sympathetically and positively. The sooner you discuss any problems with us, and the more you tell us about your full financial circumstances, the easier it will be to find a workable solution. In doing so, we will always try to make sure that you are left with enough money to pay reasonable day-to-day expenses.

If you are in financial difficulties, we will tell you where you can get free financial advice. If you ask us to, we will work with the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB). The CAB may complete a financial statement on your behalf which we will consider as the basis for negotiations with you in drawing up a debt management plan.
