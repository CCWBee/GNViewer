## 1 Overview

## Introduction

- 1.1 The 'Financial' data sheets are designed to provide the JFSC with an assessment of a Branch's balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities, its profit and loss and summary of liquidity.
- 1.2 This Guide addresses the completion of the following sheets:
- 1.2.1 '2.1 BS Assets' and '2.3 BS Liabilities': data is entered that describes the make-up of the Branch's balance sheet.
- 1.2.2 '2.4 Off-Balance Sheet': data is entered to describe the extent and nature of offbalance sheet activities.
- 1.2.3 '2.5 Profit and Loss': data is entered to describe the profit and loss to date for the current year.
- 1.2.4 '2.6 Liquidity Summary': it is populated by the data entered in sheets '2.1 BS Assets' and '2.3 BS Liabilities'.
- 1.3 Throughout, areas where data should be inputted are indicated visually in the sheets by the use of white boxes - no data should be entered elsewhere and every box should be completed, entering zero where appropriate.

## 2 '2.1 BS Assets'

## Categorisation

- 2.1 The Branch should categorise balance sheet assets by row according to the guidance in the table below.
- 2.2 For each row, the total amount should be input in the 'Total' column.
- 2.3 To the right of the input area, applicable Liquidity references are quoted for each row. These are used to summarise the Liquidity - see Section 6.
- 2.4 The designation of an asset as marketable has the following meaning:
- 2.4.1 Prices are regularly quoted for the asset;
- 2.4.2 The asset is regularly traded;
- 2.4.3 The asset is readily sold, including by repo, either on an exchange, or in a deep and liquid market, for payment in cash; and
- 2.4.4 Settlement is made according to a prescribed timetable, rather than a negotiated timetable.
- 2.5 'Past due' assets are reported in F.5, rather than according to the normal classification. Assets must be classified as 'Past due' after 90 days have passed since a payment is missed.

## 3 '2.3 BS Liabilities'

## Categorisation

- 3.1 The Branch should categorise balance sheet liabilities by row according to the guidance in the table below.
- 3.2 For each row, the total amount should be input in the 'Total' column.
- 3.3 To the right of the input area, applicable Liquidity references are quoted for each row. These are used to summarise the Liquidity - see Section 6.

| A.1    | Direct Credit Substitutes.  Direct credit substitutes almost always relate to the financial wellbeing of  a third party. In this case, the risk of loss to the Branch from the transaction is equivalent to a direct  claim on that party, i.e. the risk of loss depends on the creditworthiness of the third party.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| A.2    | Transaction Related Contingencies.  Transaction related contingents relate to the ongoing trading  activities of a counterparty where the risk of loss to the Branch depends on the likelihood of a  future event that is independent of the creditworthiness of the counterparty. They are essentially  guarantees that support particular financial obligations, rather than supporting customers' general  financial obligations.                                                                                      |
| A.3    | Trade Related Contingencies.  These comprise short-term, self-liquidating trade related items, such  as documentary letters of credit issued by the Branch, which are, or are to be, collateralised by the  underlying shipment, i.e. where the credit provides for the Branch to retain title to the underlying  shipment. Such items should be weighted according to the counterparty on whose behalf the credit  is issued whether or not the terms and conditions of the credit have yet to be complied with.         |
| A.4    | Asset sales with recourse.  Asset sales with recourse (where the credit risk remains with the bank)  fall into the weighting category determined by the asset and not the counterparty with whom the  transaction has been entered into.  Put options written where the holder of the asset is entitled to put the asset back to the Branch, e.g.  if the credit quality deteriorates, should be reported here, as should put options written by the Branch  attached to marketable instruments or other physical assets. |
| A.5    | Forward asset purchases.  Include commitments for loans and other balance sheet items with  committed drawdown. Exclude foreign currency spot deposits with value dates one or two working  days after trade date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| A.6    | Partly paid up shares and securities.  The unpaid part should only be included if there is a specific  date for the call on that part of the shares and securities held.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| A.7    | Forward deposits placed.  These comprise commitments to place deposits in the future.  Where the Branch has instead contracted to receive the deposit, failure to deliver by the  counterparty will result in an unanticipated change in its interest rate exposure and may involve a  replacement cost. Such exposures should therefore be treated as interest rate contracts (see Item  B.1).                                                                                                                           |
| A.8    | Note Issuance and Revolving Underwriting Facilities.  Note issuance facilities and revolving  underwriting facilities should include the total amounts of the Branch's underwriting obligations of  any maturity. Where the facility has been drawn down by the borrower and the notes are held by                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

|                         | anyone other than the reporting institution, the underwriting obligation should continue to be  reported at the full nominal amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| A.9   and  A.10         | Other commitments split into those with original maturity of less than 1 year (A.9) and 1 year or  over (A.10).  The OIB is regarded as having a commitment from the date the customer is advised of  the facility (e.g. the date of the letter advising the customer), regardless of whether the  commitment is revocable or irrevocable, conditional or unconditional and in particular whether or  not the facility contains a 'material adverse change' clause.  Facilities subject to annual review  should only be classified within A.9, rather than A.10, if the bank is confident there is no client  expectation of automatic renewal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| A.11                    | Commitments that are unconditionally cancellable without prior notice.  Commitments (including  the undrawn portion of any binding arrangements which obligate the reporting institution to  provide funds at some future date) that are unconditionally cancellable without prior notice other  than for 'force majeure' reason, or that effectively provide for automatic cancellation due to  deterioration in a borrower's creditworthiness. This also includes any revolving or undated/open- ended commitments, e.g. overdrafts or unused credit card lines, provided that they can be  unconditionally cancelled at any time and are subject to credit review at least annually. Facilities  should only be classified here, rather than in A.9/10, if the Branch is confident that the client is  aware of both the review process and has confirmed that the facility may be withdrawn at any time. |

## 5 '2.5 Profit and loss'

- 5.1 Sheet '2.5 Profit and Loss' should be completed to detail the Branch's Profit and Loss Account for the current financial year up to the reporting date.
- 5.2 When reporting income, a positive figure should be input for an amount that gives rise to a profit and a negative item for a loss. The sole exception to this is A.1.1.2 where the absolute amount of the interest expense should be entered.
- 5.3 For Operating Expenses, Bad debts, Extraordinary Items and Taxation, the assumption is that all these items are expenses and hence a positive figure should be entered for an amount that gives rise to a loss and a negative figure for a profit.
