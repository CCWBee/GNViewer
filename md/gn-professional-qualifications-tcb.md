## 1 Introduction

- 1.1 Paragraph 3.3 of the Codes of Practice for Trust Company Business (the TCB Codes) requires a registered person to assess and monitor the competence of its employees.
- 1.2 Specifically, paragraph 3.3.1.5 of the TCB Codes sets requirements in respect of the competency requirements for Category A and Category B trust company business employees by reference to the percentage of those, for each registered person, which must be 'suitably qualified'.
- 1.3 However, in respect of Category C trust company business employees, the TCB Codes do not include any prescribed percentage requirements regarding the number that must be suitably qualified. Rather, a registered person is required to notify the Commission should the percentage of Category C trust company business employees which either hold or are in the process of studying for a 'Table 4' or 'Table 5' qualification fall below 50% (paragraph 3.3.1.6 of the TCB Codes).
- 1.4 The assessment of whether a Category A or B trust company business employee is 'suitably qualified' includes consideration of both the professional qualifications held and the individual's relevant experience. Specific qualification requirements are established for each Category of trust company business employee in Tables 1-3 of the First Schedule of the TCB Codes (Table 1: Category A; Table 2: Category B; and Table 3: Category C).
- 1.5 This Guidance Note contains details of professional qualifications that are acceptable to the Commission when considering whether trust company business employees are 'suitably qualified'. The Guidance Note must be read in conjunction with the TCB Codes.
- 1.6 The Commission has established two tables of qualifications acceptable to the Commission known as 'Table 4' and 'Table 5', provided in sections 3 and 4 of this Guidance Note. Please note that Table 4 includes a combination of technical and non-technical qualifications.
- 1.7 Table 4 and Table 5 will be reviewed and updated periodically to take account of changes to qualifications, new qualifications, and comments received from the trust company business sector.

## 2 Variances from the TCB Code requirements

- 2.1 The Commission is aware that a wide range of professional qualifications are available and collectively 'Table 4' and 'Table 5' are not intended to be an exhaustive list of appropriate qualifications.
- 2.2 2.2 Paragraph 3.3.3 of the TCB Codes provides that, on receipt of a written application from a registered person, the Commission will consider granting a variance to the professional qualification requirements to allow the competency of a particular trust company business employee to be recognised by an alternative method. In this respect, the Commission considers the following circumstances to be relevant:
- 2.2.1 where the Commission considers the alternative qualifications to be equal to or higher than those listed in 'Table 4' or 'Table 5', this also applies to qualifications provided by an overseas awarding body;
- 2.2.2 where exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated;

Updated: 24 January 2014

- 2.2.3 where an employee has not completed the prescribed minimum relevant experience and such compliance would, in the opinion of the Commission, produce an anomalous result; or
- 2.2.4 where a Category B or C trust company business employee is studying towards one of the qualifications listed in 'Table 4' and has successfully completed certain modules.
- 2.3 At the time that trust company business came within the regulatory scope, the Commission granted two variances aimed at grandfathering existing trust company business employees. These variances (see paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5) still exist although they are now applicable to fewer individuals.
- 2.4 For all trust company business employees: the Commission will consider, on written application by a registered person, granting a variance for a specific individual from the requirement to hold a 'Table 4' or 'Table 5' qualification, where that individual attained full membership of STEP having applied on or before 31 December 1998.
- 2.5 The Commission will consider, on written application by a registered person, granting a variance from the requirement to hold, or be in the process of studying for, a 'Table 4' or 'Table 5' qualification, where an individual concerned has appropriate experience which is considered to be:
- 2.5.1 For Category A and Category B trust company business employees: relevant experience gained prior to 27 November 2000, a significant proportion of which must be at a senior level within a relevant sector (the proportion, seniority and relevance of the sector to be determined by the registered person) and certification of competence by the chief executive/managing partner of the registered person. The length of relevant experience must be:
- 2.5.2 For Category C trust company business employees: at least 3 years' relevant experience gained prior to 27 November 2000, and certification of competence by the chief executive/managing partner of the registered person.
- 2.6 Registered persons and trust company business employees are reminded that any variance granted by the Commission is limited to the employee's role at that particular registered person, and the variance does not automatically transfer with that employee should they leave one registered person and join another.

- 2.5.1.1 for Category A: at least 20 years; and

- 2.5.1.2 for Category B: at least 15 years.
