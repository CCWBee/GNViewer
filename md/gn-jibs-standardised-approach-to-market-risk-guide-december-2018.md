## 1 Overview

## Introduction

- 1.1 Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on- and off-balance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices. This guide addresses the JFSC's requirements of Jersey incorporated registered deposit takers, who are referred to herein as JIBs . JIBs with a trading book should complete the relevant reports for the trading book and report only banking book positions within the Prudential Return. All other JIBs should report all relevant risks using the relevant data entry sheets in the Prudential Return.
- 1.2 The market risks that generate a capital requirement in Jersey for all JIBs are:
- 1.2.1 Foreign exchange risk; and
- 1.2.2 Commodities risk.
- 1.3 The Prudential Return and guidance also cover settlement risk, the risks that arise through failed delivery versus payment (' DvP ') transactions and free delivery transactions. This treatment is the same for banking book and trading book transactions.
- 1.4 The rules set out here relate to the completion of four data entry sheets in the Prudential Return. These are:
- 1.5 JIBs are reminded of the requirement to ensure that they adhere to their minimum risk asset ratio requirement at all times. Where material positions are permitted by the JIB's risk limit structure, related capital requirements must be calculated daily. Settlement risk must be calculated daily for all JIBs that may have failed trades.

- 1.4.4 5.4 Settlement Risk - Capital

## 2 Sheet '5.1 FX and Gold'

## Introduction

- 2.1 The risks arising from foreign currency and gold exposures is similar and hence the form addresses both. In both cases, the bank is allowed to offset current and future exposures to arrive at a net figure.

## Foreign Exchange Positions

- 2.2 Do not report any position for the reporting currency of your bank; the return calculates a balancing item corresponding to the effective position in this currency. For most JIBs, this means that row A.1 (pounds sterling) should be blank.
- 2.3 The major currencies should be reported separately, namely Pounds Sterling ( GBP ), US Dollars ( USD ), Euros ( EUR ), Swiss Francs ( CHF ), Canadian Dollars ( CAD ), Japanese Yen ( JPY ) and Australian Dollars ( AUD ). Other currencies should be split into two groups according to whether the bank is long or short, as follows:
- 2.3.1 Other - Long Currencies : group together currencies where the net overall position in each individual currency is positive;
- 2.3.2 Other - Short Currencies : group together currencies where the net overall position in each individual currency is negative.
- 2.4 Note that the 'net overall position' is the sum of all balance sheet assets less balance sheet liabilities plus/minus net forward purchases/sales.
- 2.5 All input figures should correspond to the gross amount.

A calculated field, being the position required to make the overall total of  net long and short positions, in all currencies taken together equal to zero.                                                                                                                       |
| A      | Aggregate net long open positions.  A calculated field being the sum of all long positions  including the entry for the 'sterling balancing item' if it is positive. This aggregate of net  long open positions, which will be positive or zero, is included in the risk asset ratio  calculation. |

## 3 Sheet '5.2 Commodities'

## Introduction

- 3.1 All commodity positions should be reported using this part of the form except gold, which is treated as a currency and reported within sheet 5.1 FX &amp; Gold - see Section 2.  The JIB is required to offset current and future exposures to arrive at a net position, and the capital charge (Simplified Approach) is made up of elements for the net and gross positions.

## Reporting and calculation of capital charge

- 3.2 The groupings are:
- › A.1: Precious metals (excluding gold)
- › A.2: Base metals
- › A.3: Energy contracts
- › A.4: Other Contracts

## 3.3 All input figures should correspond to the gross amount.

## A: Commodity Positions

| Item       | Completion Notes                                                                                                                                          |

## B: Risk Weighted Asset Equivalent

| Item   | Completion Notes                                                                                                                             |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| B.0    | Risk Weighted Asset Equivalent.  The equivalent Risk Weighted Asset figure is calculated,  being 12.5 times the Simplified Approach for A.0. |

## C: Top Five Commodities

- 3.4 C.1 to C.5 are completed in the same manner as A.1 to A.4, except that:
- 3.4.1 instead of reporting all positions, split by group, the JIB need only report the five commodities that produce the largest Simplified Approach charge.
- 3.4.2 The name of the relevant commodity must be provided in the column headed 'Commodity' (no more than 50 characters).
- 3.5 No breakdown is required where the charge is less than 1% of capital.

## 4 Settlement Risk

## Introduction

- 4.1 Settlement risk arises through non-DvP trades (free deliveries) and failed DvP trades.

## Sheet '5.3 Settlement Risk - Credit Risk: Free Deliveries'

- 4.2 A free delivery occurs when a JIB has paid away (or received) its side of a transaction and has yet to receive (or pay away) the securities/cash concerned. For free deliveries, an immediate exposure arises where a JIB has settled its side of the transaction but has yet to receive the countervalue.  The JIB will be deemed to have a claim on the other party for the amount of the cash or equivalent to the current market value of the securities, whichever is still outstanding.
- 4.3 For example, if Bank A sells shares in Company C to Bank B and if Bank B pays for the shares immediately and Bank A is to deliver at some future date, Bank B should hold capital for counterparty risk on Bank A in addition to capital for the risk relating to holding Company C shares. This is because Bank B is exposed for the whole amount of the value of the shares to Bank A until delivery takes place.
- 4.4 The requirement for free deliveries should be calculated as:
- 4.4.1 Four working days or less past settlement date: The risk weighted assets ( RWA ) should be the counterparty claim multiplied by the counterparty risk weight;
- 4.4.2 More than four working days past settlement date: The counterparty claim must be provided a capital treatment - see Sheet 5.4 Settlement Risk - Capital
- 4.5 For clarity, this treatment should also be applied to exchange traded contracts involving physical delivery. No requirements arise in respect of delivery risk on spot and forward foreign exchange transactions are considered necessary.
- 4.6 Where the transaction is effected across a national border, the JFSC considers that there is a window of one working day before the exposure should be included in the return.

## C:  Free delivery transactions, 4 days or less since delivery

| Item             | Completion Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Total            | Mark-to-Market Receivable.  The sum of the Mark-to-Market Receivable for C.1.1 to C.1.5.                                                                                                                                                 |

## Sheet '5.4 Settlement Risk-Capital': Failed DvP trades and non-DvP trades that are more than 4 days past settlement date.

- 4.7 Whether or not a transaction involving the delivery of an instrument against the receipt of cash attracts a counterparty risk charge during its life, a capital charge should apply in cases of unsettled transactions as defined below.
- 4.7.1 An unsettled transaction is one where delivery of the instrument is due to take place against the receipt of cash, but which remains unsettled more than 4 business days after the due settlement date.
- 4.7.2 As an example of where this is applicable, if Bank A sells shares in Company C to Bank B and Bank A fails to deliver on time, Bank B should hold capital for counterparty risk on Bank A in addition to capital for specific risk on Company C. This is because if the price moves in Bank B's favour, then the risk is that Bank A will not deliver and Bank B will have to pay a higher price to replace the purchase.
- 4.8 In principle, JIBs' systems should be set up in such a manner that, where a deal attracts a counterparty risk charge, this charge continues to apply when settlement is due but has not been completed. JIBs are expected to adopt this for all such transactions.
- 4.9 No capital charges in respect of settlement risk on spot and forward foreign exchange transactions of any type are considered necessary.
- 4.10 For the avoidance of doubt, this sheet should be used to report non-DVP trades that attract a capital treatment (see paragraph 4.4.2)
- 4.11 Unsettled transactions should attract a capital cost based upon the difference between the amount due and the current market value of the instrument, if this has a potential loss. The capital requirement should be this potential loss multiplied by the factor in the table below.
- 4.12 This applies only to trades where a loss may arise for the JIB if the trade fails to settle. Failed trades must be reported once the date is more than four days after the agreed settlement date.
- 4.13 Note that the capital requirement for such transactions is not multiplied by the counterparty risk weight.

## A: Factors for failed DvP transactions

| Number of working days after due  settlement date.   | Item   | Factor   |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|
| 5 - 15                                               | A.1    | 8%       |
| 16 - 30                                              | A.2    | 50%      |
| 31 - 45                                              | A.3    | 75%      |
| 46 or more                                           | A.4    | 100%     |

- 4.14 For failed non-DVP trades that are more than 4 days past settlement date, the Factor is 100%.
