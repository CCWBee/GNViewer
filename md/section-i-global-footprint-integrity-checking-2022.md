## 1 Introduction

- 1.1 The JFSC will once again be requesting the provision of specified data through completion of a number of Excel workbooks. Section I of the exercise collects substantially the same data as the JFSC has collected for years 2017 to 2021.
- 1.2 This guide is intended to assist Reporting Entities perform a 'sense check' on the completed Section I - Global Footprint Excel workbook prior to submitting it to the JFSC by highlighting the:
- 1.2.1 mandatory questions (section 2); and
- 1.2.2 relational questions (section 3).
- 1.3 On submission of your Section I Excel workbook you will receive an email confirming that you have successfully submitted your data. If you do not receive an email please contact myjfsc@jerseyfsc.org as there may be an issue with your submission.
- 1.4 Please note that whilst your submission may be successfully received by the JFSC, you may be contacted by a member of the Supervision division to discuss your data if any of the mandatory questions remain unanswered, or the relationship between certain questions has not been maintained.
- 1.5 To limit the number of 'failed' submissions, Reporting Entities are advised to consider sections 2 and 3 of this guide before submitting their data.
