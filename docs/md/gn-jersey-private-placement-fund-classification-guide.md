This guide is available for reference for existing Jersey Private Placement Funds (PPF). Following the introduction of the Jersey Private Fund Guide in April 2017 PPFs can no longer be established. Please note that the reference to the Dear CEO letter in Section 3.3. of the PPF Guide has been superseded by the recast of Schedule 2 of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999. In this regard also please refer to the Guidelines on interpretation of Article 36 of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.12.

## Objective

The purpose of this guide is to set out the eligibility conditions for a Private Placement Fund.  A Private Placement Fund which satisfies the eligibility conditions set out in this Guide may be established using a streamlined authorisation process, as described in Section 1 of this Guide.  If a proposed investment fund does not fully satisfy such conditions, a request may be made to the JFSC for derogations and regulatory consent to be granted on such terms as the JFSC may determine. Such derogation applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will not be on a fasttrack basis.

## 1 Section 1: Structure

- 1.1 A Private Placement Fund is an investment fund established in Jersey as a Closed-ended Fund or established in a country or territory outside Jersey as a Closed-ended Fund but managed in Jersey, the Units of which are offered to not more than 50 potential investors in Jersey or elsewhere, each of whom is a Professional Investor or a Sophisticated Investor. A Private Placement Fund will be required, as appropriate, to obtain consent in accordance with the provisions of COBO  i  for the issue of shares, units or securities or for the creation of partnership interests or for the raising of money in Jersey for the circulation of a Private Placement Memorandum.  A Private Placement Fund may not be a collective investment fund within the meaning of the Collective Investment Funds (Jersey) Law 1988, as amended.
- 1.2 A Private Placement Fund established in Jersey shall take the form of a company incorporated under the laws of Jersey (including a protected cell company, an incorporated cell company or any cell thereof) or one or more partnerships (including limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships, separate limited partnerships or incorporated limited partnerships) or a unit trust constituted under the laws of Jersey and a Private Placement Fund established in a country or territory outside Jersey shall be incorporated or constituted, as applicable, in such equivalent form as is permitted under the laws of such country or territory.
- 1.3 If a Private Placement Fund is established as a protected cell of a protected cell company, the requisite COBO consent to issue units in the Private Placement Fund shall be issued in respect of such protected cell to the protected cell company.
- 1.4 If a Private Placement Fund is established as a company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, not less than two Jersey resident directors with appropriate experience must be appointed to the board of the fund.  If a Private Placement Fund is a company incorporated under the laws of a country or territory outside Jersey, either (a) not less than two Jersey resident directors with appropriate experience must be appointed to the board of the fund; or (b) a company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, having not less than two Jersey resident directors with appropriate experience appointed to its board, must be appointed as manager of the fund.
- 1.5 If a Private Placement Fund is established as one or more limited partnerships, separate limited partnerships or incorporated limited partnerships constituted under the laws of Jersey or a country or territory outside Jersey, it must have at least one general partner which is either (a) a company incorporated under the laws of Jersey and which has not less than two Jersey resident directors with appropriate experience appointed to the board of that company or (b) itself a limited partnership, separate limited partnership or incorporated limited partnership that has at least one general partner which is a company incorporated under the laws of Jersey and which has not less than two Jersey resident directors with appropriate experience appointed to the board of that company.
- 1.6 If a Private Placement Fund is established as a unit trust constituted under the laws of Jersey or a country or territory outside Jersey, each of the trustee and the manager (or the managing trustee) of the Private Placement Fund must be a company incorporated under the laws of Jersey and which has not less than two Jersey resident directors with appropriate experience appointed to its board.
- 1.7 A Private Placement Fund must be administered by an administrator which is a Designated Service Provider.  In the case of a Private Placement Fund which takes the form of a company incorporated under the laws of Jersey or limited partnership constituted under the laws of

Issued: 26 January 2012 Updated: 31 May 2013

Jersey, the Designated Service Provider must provide the registered office to the company or limited partnership.  In the case of a Private Placement Fund which takes the form of a unit trust constituted under the laws of Jersey, the Designated Service Provider must provide the registered office either to the trustee or to the manager (or to the managing trustee, as the case may be).  In the case of a Private Placement Fund established in a country or territory outside Jersey, the Designated Service Provider must provide the registered office of the relevant Service Provider to the Private Placement Fund in Jersey.  In addition to the above, the Designated Service Provider must provide support to the Private Placement Fund in relation to its anti-money laundering obligations where required under Section 3.3 of this Guide.

- 1.8 The board of directors of a company, the Jersey general partner of any limited partnership, separate limited partnership or incorporated limited partnership and the trustee or manager (or managing trustee) of a unit trust, which constitutes a Private Placement Fund (as the case may be), is responsible for the management and control of the Private Placement Fund in accordance with and subject to the Constitutive Documents, the Private Placement Memorandum, this Guide and applicable law.  In the case of a Private Placement Fund which is established under the laws of a country or territory outside Jersey, the directors of the company, general partner, trustee and manager (or managing trustee) as the case may be and the Jersey manager of the Private Placement Fund are responsible for the management and control of the Private Placement Fund in accordance with and subject to the Constitutive Documents, the Private Placement Memorandum, this Guide and applicable law.
- 1.9 Only Professional Investors, Sophisticated Investors and/or investment managers if acquiring an interest in a Private Placement Fund directly or indirectly for or on behalf of nonprofessional or non-sophisticated investors, each of whom has received an investment warning substantially in the form set out in Section 4.2 of this Guide may invest in a Private Placement Fund.  The investment warning must be contained in the Private Placement Memorandum and in its application or subscription form or agreement of adherence and such form, agreement (or an alternative written instrument of acknowledgement of such warning) must be signed by or on behalf of the Professional Investor or Sophisticated Investor (as the case may be) or signed by an investment manager if acquiring an interest in the Private Placement Fund directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of non-professional or non-sophisticated investors.  By subscribing for or acquiring Units in a Private Placement Fund, the holder of such Units or person acquiring such Units shall have represented to the Private Placement Fund that such holder or such acquirer is a Professional Investor or Sophisticated Investor (as the case may be).  The board of directors, general partner, trustee, manager or managing trustee (as the case may be) shall be entitled to rely upon such representation for these purposes.
- 1.10 Professional Investors and Sophisticated Investors are deemed to be able to evaluate the financial risks of a Private Placement Fund and to bear the economic consequences of investment in a Private Placement Fund, including the possibility of loss of the entire investment.  The requirements of this Guide shall not be satisfied if an investment fund (for the purposes of this section, an Applicant Fund ) has, without the consent of the JFSC, associated with it any ancillary scheme or arrangement (for the purposes of this section, a Feeder Fund ) whose sole or exclusive purpose is to invest in the Applicant Fund and the Feeder Fund has any investors who are not Professional Investors or Sophisticated Investors.
- 1.11 On the basis that Units in a Private Placement Fund may be offered only to Professional Investors and Sophisticated Investors in accordance with the provisions of this Guide, the JFSC will not apply the JFSC's Promoter Policy in relation to an application for consent under COBO

- 1.12.1 have had no disciplinary sanctions imposed on it by any supervisory authority or professional body in the previous five years;

- 1.14 Consent(s) to the issue of Units in a Private Placement Fund under COBO will be issued by the JFSC on a fast-track, self-certification procedure relying upon receipt of each of the following:
- 1.14.1 A written statement from the promoter to the JFSC confirming that it satisfies the requirements set out in Sections 1.12 and 1.13 counter-signed by the Designated Service Provider certifying that such Designated Service Provider has carried out its own general due diligence in relation to the promoter and has no reason to believe that the promoter's statement is incorrect.  The Designated Service Provider is required to retain in Jersey documents relating to such due diligence enquiries and to make such documents available to the JFSC upon request.

Issued: 26 January 2012 Updated: 31 May 2013

with the non-English language version must be lodged with the JFSC.  Confirmation should be provided to the Designated Service Provider by the translator that the nonEnglish language version of the document lodged with the JFSC is a true and accurate translation of the English language version.  A statement should be included in both documents stating which language version will take precedence in the event of a dispute, failing which (or in the event of a conflict in construction) it shall be presumed that the English language was intended to prevail.

- 1.14.5 A completed Application Form.
- 1.15 The JFSC will use its best endeavours to authorise the Private Placement Fund and issue the requisite COBO consent within 3 working days from receipt of a correctly completed Application Form.  It is acknowledged that a Designated Service Provider's due diligence enquiries in relation to a promoter can only extend to sources of enquiry available to it and not those beyond its reach.  In the event that the promoter is not able to satisfy fully these criteria prior clearance should be sought from the JFSC.  A promoter that has previously established a Private Placement Fund may, in satisfaction of the above requirements, submit a confirmation in writing to the JFSC counter-signed by the Designated Service Provider referred to in Section 1.14.1 that the Designated Service Provider has reviewed the due diligence information that it holds on the promoter and that there have been no material changes to the information most recently provided to the JFSC in that regard.
- 1.16 The JFSC would expect the Designated Service Provider to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the promoter of the Private Placement Fund meets the requirements set out in Sections 1.12 and 1.13.
- 1.17 The JFSC will carry out its own regulatory checks in relation to the promoter and its Principal Persons following the issue of the requisite COBO consent and, should such checks give rise to a concern, the JFSC may undertake any (depending on the nature of the concern) of the following:
- 1.17.1 request further information in relation to the promoter;
- 1.17.2 require the replacement of any Service Provider including the promoter or any one or more of the Principal Persons, officers or employees of the promoter;
- 1.17.3 revoke such COBO consent; or
- 1.17.4 take such other action as it deems appropriate in the circumstances in its absolute discretion.
- 1.18 Depending on the nature of its concern, the JFSC may not be able to disclose the nature of its concerns to the Private Placement Fund's Designated Service Provider or investors but the JFSC will consider the best interests of the investors in exercising its discretion and, where appropriate, will seek investor representations before acting.  The JFSC may refuse to accept future certificates and applications under this Guide from a Designated Service Provider where certificates or applications have been found to have been defective or made without an appropriate level of due diligence in the relevant circumstances.
- 1.19 The Designated Service Provider of a Private Placement Fund will be responsible for submitting to the JFSC statistics in relation to the Private Placement Fund in accordance with the JFSC's requirements from time to time.

- 1.21 Nothing in any of the Constitutive Documents of a Private Placement Fund shall exclude the jurisdiction of the courts of Jersey to hear an action concerning the Private Placement Fund, save to the extent that investors in the Private Placement Fund agree in its Constitutive Documents that disputes arising out of, or in connection with, the Constitutive Documents may be finally settled under specified rules of arbitration.
