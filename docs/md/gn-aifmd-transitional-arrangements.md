## AIFMD i  Regime:

## Transitional Arrangements, Exemptions and JFSC Forms

Issued: 12 July 2013

## 1 Document Overview

- 1.1 This Guidance Note is of interest to any person that is:
- 1.1.1 an Alternative Investment Fund ( AIF ), within the meaning of the Alternative Investment Funds (Jersey) Regulations 2012 (the AIF Regulations );
- 1.1.2 an Alternative Investment Fund Manager ( AIFM ), either within the meaning of AIF services business (Article 2(11) of the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 (the FS(J)L ) or a sub-threshold AIFM within the meaning of the AIF Regulations; or
- 1.1.3 a depositary appointed to an AIF which has an EU/EEA AIFM.

## 1.2 This Guidance Note provides:

- 1.2.1 a detailed description of the provisions made in the Alternative Investment Funds (Jersey) Order 2013 (the AIF Order ) and the Financial Services (Amendment of Schedule 2 to Law) (No. 4) (Jersey) Order 2013 (the Amendment No. 4 Order ) (together the Orders ) in relation to:
- 1.2.1.1 the transitional arrangements currently in the process of being defined by various Member States of the European Union ( EU ) or other European Economic Area ( EEA ) States that have adopted the AIFMD (together the Transitional Arrangements ); and
- 1.2.1.2 the exemptions which may apply where there are no applicable Transitional Arrangements; and
- 1.2.2 a brief description of the new and amended application and notification forms (together the AIFMD Forms ) which will apply from 22 July 2013, where there are no applicable Transitional Arrangements or exemptions.

## 2 Transitional Arrangements

- 2.1 The Transitional Arrangements, taken in conjunction with the Orders, will have the effect that Jersey's AIFMD regime will not apply in certain circumstances, as more fully described below. This should ensure that Jersey AIFs and AIFMs will not be put at a disadvantage compared with AIFs and AIFMs from EU or EEA States.

Issued: 12 July 2013

- 2.2 Transitional Arrangements will not apply to all AIFs or AIFMs nor will all EU and EEA States that have implemented the AIFMD necessarily invoke them.  It may be the case that a particular AIF or AIFM does not qualify to benefit from the Transitional Arrangements (by virtue, for example, of the fact that it is not an existing AIF or AIFM marketing in an EU or EEA State to which the AIFMD applies before 22 July 2013).  Further, the Transitional Arrangements adopted by one EU or EEA State may vary materially from the Transitional Arrangements adopted by another.
- 2.3 The Jersey Transitional Arrangements may apply to:
- 2.3.1 AIFs as detailed in the AIF Order;
- 2.3.2 AIFMs, except a sub-threshold AIFM, as detailed in the Amendment No.4 Order; and
- 2.3.3 a sub-threshold AIFM as detailed in the AIF Order.

## The AIF Order

- 2.4 The AIF Order supplements the AIF Regulations which makes provision for the implementation of the AIFMD.
- 2.5 Article 2(3) of the AIF Order facilitates the use by AIFs of Transitional Arrangements by not requiring them to hold a certificate under Regulation 7 of the AIF Regulations for so long as the national laws of the Member State of the EU or other EEA State in which the AIF is being marketed or managed do not require compliance by the AIF with the AIFMD.
- 2.6 Article 4(5) of the AIF Order provides that a 'sub-threshold' AIFM ii  within the meaning of Article 3(b) of the AIF Order, will not need to be approved by the JFSC for so long as the national laws of the Member State of the EU or other EEA State in which the AIFM is marketing or managing the particular AIF do not require compliance by the AIFM with the AIFMD.

## Amendment No. 4 Order

- 2.7 The Amendment No. 4 Order amends Schedule 2 to the FS(J)L (the Schedule ) in relation to certain AIF services business, specifically, Article 4 adds a new Part 5 to the Schedule to deal with persons carrying on AIF services business caught within the scope of Article 2(11) of the FS(J)L.
- 2.8 Paragraph 23(3) of Part 5 of the Schedule has the effect of facilitating the use of Transitional Arrangements by exempting a person, carrying on AIF services business within the meaning of Article 2(11) of the FS(J)L, from the requirement to register as such under Article 7(1) of the FS(J)L, if:
- 2.8.1 the person is carrying on the marketing or management of an AIF in a Member State of the EU or other EEA State to which the AIFMD applies; and provided that,
- 2.8.2 the relevant EU/EEA State's national laws do not require compliance by the person carrying on AIF services business with the AIFMD.

## 3 Exemptions

- 3.4 These exemptions may also apply to AIFMs which are persons, as detailed in the Amendment No. 4 Order.
- 3.5 Paragraph 23(1)(a) and (b) of Part 5 of the Schedule exempt certain persons carrying on AIF services business from being required to register as an AIF services business under Article 2(11) of the FS(J)L provided that the JFSC has granted its prior permission in writing for the relevant AIF to be marketed in a Member State of the EU or other EEA State to which the AIFMD applies.

## 3.6 These AIFMs are persons:

- 3.6.1 with an existing registration, under Article 2(10) of the FS(J)L to carry on any one or more classes of fund services business (an FSB ) in relation to an unclassified fund or an unregulated fund, where that registration includes the same functions as the AIF services business; or
