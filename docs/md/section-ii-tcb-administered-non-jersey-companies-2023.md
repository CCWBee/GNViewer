## 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Background

- 1.1.1 The Jersey Financial Services Commission ( JFSC ) has been collecting supervisory risk data from reporting entities since 2018.
- 1.1.2 In support of the legal persons and arrangements national risk assessment ( 2023 LPA NRA i ), the JFSC collected data in 2022 from a subset of the Trust Company Business ( TCB ) sector regarding the non-Jersey incorporated companies which they administer. The data collection in 2022 did not collect data from all relevant TCBs, rather data was collected in respect of 46% of the non-Jersey incorporated companies understood to be administered by TCBs (calculated using 2021 year-end data).
- 1.1.3 In 2023 LPA NRA, TCB administered non-Jersey incorporated companies are reported as presenting a medium-high risk of ML/TF. Whilst the risks associated are similar to the risks associated with Jersey companies, these risks may be heightened due to different incorporation requirements and controls in the home jurisdiction as these may be less stringent than those applied in Jersey.
- 1.1.4 Section 3.4 of Consultation Paper No.9 2023 ii  notes that, as well as informing the 2023 LPA NRA, the data on non-Jersey incorporated companies administered by TCBs is valuable in informing the JFSC's risk understanding of the TCB sector. Consequently, the JFSC proposed continuing to collect the data on an annual basis. The feedback to this proposal was not adverse and paragraph 1.3.2 of the Feedback Paper iii  confirms that, as part of its 2023 data collection exercise, the JFSC will repeat the collection of the data points first collected in 2022.
- 1.1.5 Unlike in 2022 this data collection is not targeted. All TCBs that administer non-Jersey incorporated companies are requested to complete the Excel workbook.
- 1.1.6 Consideration of risk at a national level is an ongoing activity therefore the JFSC may provide an aggregated view of the information collected to other Jersey authorities for risk assessment purposes. No individual TCB will be identified as part of data sharing.

## 1.2 Scope

- 1.2.1 This guidance document relates to Section II of the 2023 risk based supervision data collection which requires the provision of activity based data from Reporting Entities registered to carry on TCBs where they, or one of their participating members, provides services to a non-Jersey incorporated company.
- 1.2.2 Where a Reporting Entity is an Affiliation Leader, its responses to the questions in the Excel workbook should cover all members of that affiliation.
- 1.2.3 For the purpose of this data collection TCB is defined in Article 2(3) and (4) of the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 ( FS(J)L ) (as at 31 December 2023) as follows:
