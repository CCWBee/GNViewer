## 1 Overview

## Introduction

- 1.1 Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on- and off-balance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices. This guide addresses the JFSC's requirements of Jersey operations of the OIBs who are referred to herein as Branches. There is no variance in the return or the guidance dependent on whether or not the Branch has a trading book.
- 1.2 The JFSC's reporting requirements are intended to provide it with an indication of the Branch's market risk profile.
- 1.3 The rules set out here relate to the completion of four data entry sheets in the Prudential Return. These are:
- 1.4 Settlement risk is the risk that arises through free delivery transactions and failed delivery versus payment ( DvP) transactions.
- 1.5 Counterparty risk relating to derivatives is the risk of incurring the cost of having to replace derivatives transactions in the event of the failure of a counterparty.

- 1.3.1 5.1 FX &amp; Gold

- 1.3.2 5.2 Commodities

- 1.3.3 5.5 Branch Settlement Risk

- 1.3.4 5.6 OTC

## 2 '5.1 FX and Gold'

## Introduction

- 2.1 The risks arising from foreign currency and gold exposures are similar and hence the form addresses both. In both cases, current and future exposures may be offset so as to arrive at a net figure.

## Foreign Exchange Positions

- 2.2 Do not report any position for the reporting currency of your Branch; the return calculates a balancing item corresponding to the effective position in this currency. For most Branches, this means that row A.1 (Pounds Sterling) should be blank.
- 2.3 The major currencies should be reported separately, namely Pounds Sterling ( GBP ), US Dollars ( USD ), Euros ( EUR ), Swiss Francs ( CHF ), Canadian Dollars ( CAD ), Japanese Yen ( JPY ) and Australian Dollars ( AUD ). Other currencies should be split into two groups according to whether the bank is long or short, as follows:
- 2.3.1 Other - Long Currencies : group together currencies where the net overall position in each individual currency is positive;
- 2.3.2 Other - Short Currencies : group together currencies where the net overall position in each individual currency is negative.
- 2.4 Note that the 'net overall position' is the sum of all balance sheet assets less balance sheet liabilities plus/minus net forward purchases/sales.
- 2.5 All input figures should correspond to the gross amount.

## 4 '5.5 Branch Settlement Risk'

## Introduction

- 4.1 Settlement risk arises through non-DvP trades (free deliveries) and failed DvP trades.

## NonDvP trades (free deliveries)

- 4.2 A free delivery occurs when a Branch has paid away (or received) its side of a transaction and has yet to receive (or pay away) the securities/cash concerned. For free deliveries, an immediate exposure arises where a Branch has settled its side of the transaction but has yet to receive the countervalue.  The Branch will be deemed to have a claim on the other party for the amount of the cash or equivalent to the current market value of the securities, whichever is still outstanding.

- 4.3 Disclosure of all such trades is required, allocated between:
- 4.3.1 Four working days or less past settlement date; and
- 4.3.2 More than four working days past settlement date.
- 4.4 For clarity, this treatment should also be applied to exchange traded contracts involving physical delivery. No capital charges in respect of delivery risk on spot and forward foreign exchange transactions are considered necessary.
- 4.5 Where the transaction is effected across a national border, the JFSC considers that there is a window of one working day before the exposure should be included in the return.

## Failed DvP trades

- 4.6 A failed trade is one where delivery of the instrument is due to take place against the receipt of cash, but which remains unsettled five business days after the due settlement date.
- 4.7 No disclosure is required in respect of settlement risk on spot and forward foreign exchange transactions.

## Disclosure requirements

- 4.8 Unsettled transactions should be reported according to the number of working days after the due settlement date.
- 4.9 The figures that must be reported are:

Calculated as the total Loss if trade  fails/Mark-to-Market Receivable for A.1 to A.4 plus B.1 to B.2.                                                    |

## 5 '5.6 OTC'

## Introduction

- 5.1 This worksheet sets out a required breakdown of OTC contracts held by type and by maturity. This provides to the JFSC an indication of activity undertaken and the risks that are present within the Branch. Contracts should be reported gross, with no netting.

## OTC contracts, except for credit derivatives

- 5.2 Report the amount (nominal) of all outstanding contracts and the total of all positive mark-tomarket values (i.e. ignoring any offsetting negative mark-to-market values). Contracts should be separated into:
- 5.2.1 N.1: Interest rate contracts; where the value of the contract is predominantly or only determined by interest rates;
- 5.2.2 N.2: FX &amp; Gold; where the value of the contract is predominantly or only determined by foreign exchange rates or the value of gold;
- 5.2.3 N.3: Equities contracts; where the value of the contract is predominantly or only determined by the value of precious metals;
- 5.2.4 N.4: Precious metals contracts; where the value of the contract is predominantly or only determined by the value of precious metals; and
- 5.2.5 N.5: Commodities contracts; where the value of the contract is predominantly or only determined by the value of other commodities
