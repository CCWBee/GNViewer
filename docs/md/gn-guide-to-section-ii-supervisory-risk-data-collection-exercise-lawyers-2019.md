## 1 General guidance

## 1.1 Scope

- 1.1.1 In 2018 the JFSC collected supervisory risk data for Reporting Entities for the first time. This exercise was repeated in 2019 and, as advised on 30 October 2019 i , the JFSC is collecting the same data in 2020.
- 1.1.2 This guidance document relates to Section II of the 2020 risk based supervision data collection which requires the provision of activity based data from Reporting Entities registered to carry on legal services.
- 1.1.3 Legal services is a financial services business activity as set out in Schedule 2 to the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, specifically paragraph 1 of Part B of Schedule 2 (see below).
- 1 Lawyers
- 1. The business of providing services by independent legal professionals.
- 2. In this paragraph 'independent legal professionals' means those who by way of business provide legal or notarial services to third parties when participating in financial, or immovable property, transactions concerning any of the following -
- a) the buying and selling of immovable property or business entities;
- b) the buying and selling of shares the ownership of which entitles the owner to occupy immovable property;
- c) the managing of client money, securities or other assets;
- d) the opening or management of bank, savings or securities accounts;
- e) the organization of contributions necessary for the creation, operation or management of companies; or
- f) the creation, operation or management of trusts, companies or similar structures.

## 1.2 Excel workbook

- 1.2.1 The Excel workbook for a reporting entity carrying on legal services comprises 5 spreadsheets, as follows:
- (a) AA - Compliance Data
- (b) AB - Client Data
- (c) AC - Beneficial Ownership
- (d) AD - Use and application of concessions granted by the MLO ii
- (e) AE - Country List
- 1.2.2 Spreadsheet AE is an input sheet for the responses to questions AA8, AC1, AC2, AD4 and AD7.

## 1.3 Clients and matters

- 1.3.1 The spreadsheets require lawyers to provide data in respect of their clients.
- 1.3.2 A client is a person to whom the lawyer provides one or more of the services in 1.1.3 above.

Lawyers

- 1.3.3 However, it is understood that some law firms may find it difficult to provide the requested information at a client level, as they record 'matters' rather than clients (each matter being a piece of business conducted for a client, meaning that a lawyer may conduct several matters for the same client during a period).
- 1.3.4 For example, Mr X approaches a law firm to carry out the following services:
- (a) to act for him in the purchase of a property, and
- (b) to act for him in respect of the sale of a company which is beneficially owned by him.
- In this case the law firm would have one client and two matters.
- 1.3.5 If a law firm is unable to provide data analysed by client, the JFSC will accept the data analysed by matter. It is understood that this will result in an element of duplication.

## 1.4 Data reporting period

- 1.4.1 Generally, data should be provided for the period 1/1/2019 to 31/12/2019.
- 1.4.2 There are a few data items where the data should be provided as at the end of the reporting period (31/12/2019 or closest business day).

## 1.5 Data Submission

- 1.5.1 Whilst the JFSC will be collecting the same data as it did in 2019, law firms are still recommended to consider the data request as soon as possible. It may take some time to gather the data requested and the deadline for submission is 17:00 on 31 March 2020 .
- 1.5.2 Each law firm will be submitting a completed Excel Workbook for Section II through the JFSC Portal, and each law firm has a designated individual who is the JFSC Portal contact, which, in the vast majority of cases, is the money laundering compliance officer.
- 1.5.3 Notwithstanding that the JFSC Portal contact has responsibility for submitting the data, the board, or equivalent, of the law firm should have oversight of the content of the submission made on their behalf.
- 1.5.4 Having completed the data return twice the JFSC expects law firms to be in a better position to report their 2019 data and that only on an exceptional basis will responses be derived by extrapolation or estimates supported by specific criteria
- 1.5.5 The JFSC continues to acknowledge that system changes take time to implement. Where a law firm needs to extrapolate or estimate its data as system changes are still being implemented, the comments section at the bottom of the relevant spreadsheet should highlight which data elements have been extrapolated/ estimated and when the relevant system changes will take effect.
- 1.5.6 Where the law firm feels it necessary to provide additional data to enable the JFSC to understand the response, this information should also be included in the comments section at the bottom of each relevant spreadsheet.
- 1.5.7 With the exception of spreadsheet AE-Lawyers-Country list , all parts of each question should be answered. Consequently, please insert a '0' where relevant.

## 1.6 Integrity checking your submission

- 1.6.1 Before submitting your data the JFSC suggests that the integrity checks highlighted in paragraphs 1.6.2 to 1.6.8 should be completed.
- 1.6.2 Sum of AA1(a) to (c) needs to agree to the sum of AB1(i) to (viii).
- 1.6.3 AA1(a) should equal sum of AB3(i) to (viii).
- 1.6.4 No response in AB2 should exceed AB1, in any given column.
- 1.6.5 AB3 to AB11 cannot be individually greater than AB2, in any column.
- 1.6.6 AB11 should not exceed AB9 or AB10 in any given column.
- 1.6.7 AB11 should not exceed AB4.
- 1.6.8 AD10(a) should equal the sum of AD10(b) to (g).

## 2 Section AA - Lawyers compliance data

## 2.1 Overview

- 2.1.1 This section collects data on:
- (a) client risk ratings;
- (b) business which has been declined, terminated or withdrawn due to customer due diligence or other financial crime concerns;
- (c) referred business (the extent to which clients are obtained on the basis of referrals from other businesses) and
- (d) cash transactions (the extent to which cash is used).

## 2.2 Risk Rating

- AA1 Number of clients in each category of risk (as defined by the law firm) during the data reporting period
- AA2 Do the law firm's risk ratings include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism? IF Yes, please provide details at AA15(a)
- 2.2.1 Question AA1 requests data about the number of clients that have been assessed as presenting (a) higher, (b) standard or (c) lower ML/TF risk (on the basis of factors set out in section 3.3.4 of the Legal Sector AML/CFT Handbook).
- 2.2.2 Where use is made of a more precise risk scoring scale, it will be necessary to determine which categories in that scale approximate to higher iii , standard or lower risk. For example, if a law firm measures risk on a score of 1 to 10, it may consider anything between 1 and 3 to present a lower risk, 4 to 7 to present a standard risk, and 8 to 10 to present a higher risk.
- 2.2.3 If a law firm includes other factors e.g. commercial risk, in its risk rating of clients and the ML/TF risk element cannot be reported separately, please report the combined risk rating.
- 2.2.4 If a combined rating is reported please select 'yes' when responding to AA2 .
- 2.2.5 Please provide an answer for every element of AA1. For example a law firm with zero higher risk, 4 medium risk and 6 lower risk clients and who only considers money laundering and terrorist financing when risk rating a client, should complete the fields as follows:
- 2.2.6 Please note the sum of AA1(a) to (c) should equal the sum of AB1(i) to (viii).
- AA3 If the law firm risk rates the beneficial owners/controllers of clients or other persons, who must be identified under Article 3 of the MLO, the number in each category of risk (as defined by the law firm) during the data reporting period
- AA4 Do the law firm's risk ratings as specified above include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism? If Yes, please provide details at AA15(b)

| AA1(a) - Higher   | 0                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| AA1(b) - Medium   | 4                             |
| AA1(c) - Lower    | 6                             |
| AA2               | Choose 'No' from the dropdown |

- 2.2.7 It is not a requirement of the MLO or Legal Sector AML/CFT Handbook for a law firm to risk rate the beneficial owners and controllers of their clients. However, the JFSC would like to understand the extent to which this happens in practice.
- 2.2.8 If a law firm does risk rate the beneficial owners and controllers of their clients, question AA3 should be answered. The guidance in 2.2.2 above should be followed where appropriate.
- 2.2.9 If a law firm does not risk rate the beneficial owners and controllers of their clients, please insert a '0' in cells AA3(a)-(c) and select 'N/A' from the drop down menu at AA4 .

## 2.3 Declined, terminated and withdrawn business

- AA5 Number of applications from prospective clients to either (i) establish a client relationship, or (ii) carry out a one-off transaction, declined due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns, during the data reporting period

## AA6 Number of client relationships terminated , due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns, during the data reporting period

- 2.3.1 In line with Section 2.4.1 of the Legal Sector AML/CFT Handbook (paragraph 97), questions AA5 and AA6 request data about:
- (a) the number of prospective client relationships or one-off transactions that have been declined ( AA5 ); and
- (b) client relationships that have been terminated due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns ( AA6 ).

This will include cases where:

- › it has not been possible to complete identification measures (before or during a client relationship) under the Money Laundering Order, including establishing the source of funds;
- › the ML/TF risk has been assessed as being too high (and so outside the law firm's risk appetite); and
- › there is suspicion of ML/TF.
- 2.3.2 This question applies also to cases where:
- (a) an application to form a client relationship or carry out a one-off transaction is handled by a third party, e.g. another law firm, and where there is no direct contact with the prospective client; and
- (b) an application to form a client relationship or carry out a one-off transaction has not yet been formally submitted, e.g. where CDD is applied at the time that business is being solicited (where this data is recorded).
- 2.3.3 Please do not leave fields blank, insert a '0' in AA5 and AA6 if no prospective clients have been declined or clients terminated.

## AA7 Number of applications from prospective clients who have withdrawn due to CDD issues, during the data reporting period (where this data is collected)

- 2.3.4 Question AA7 collects data on client applications withdrawn solely or partly on the basis of CDD requested.
- 2.3.5 It is recognised that this data may not be recorded by a law firm. If this is the case please respond with '0'. Do not leave the field blank.

- 2.3.6 This question also applies to cases where an application to form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction is handled by a third party, e.g. another law firm, and where there is no direct contact with the prospective client.

## 2.4 Referred business

- 2.4.1 Questions AA8, AA9 and AA10 request data about those persons who referred clients to a law firm on a regular basis during the data reporting period.
- 2.4.2 Where business is referred to a law firm but neither a one-off transaction nor client relationship result this is not considered referred business for the purpose of responding to AA8, AA9 and AA10.
- 2.4.3 Persons who refer clients to a law firm may be third parties such as other lawyers, accountants and trust company businesses.
- 2.4.4 Additionally, if a law firm is part of a group, any referrals from group companies or other branches of the same company should be included here. For example, if a Jersey law firm is part of a group/company that has a Guernsey company/branch then referrals from the Guernsey operation should be reported.
- 2.4.5 The following should not be reported as persons who refer clients:
- (a) a third party or group entity that acts as an obliged person under Articles 16 or 16A of the Money Laundering Order (data on these persons is collected through spreadsheet AD (Use of MLO concessions)); or
- (b) a client acting on behalf of one or more third parties (data on these persons is collected through spreadsheet AC (3 rd  party and beneficial ownership)); or
- (c) a person who refers clients on a basis that cannot be considered regular. The meaning of regular will vary by law firm and will depend on a number of factors such as the size of their current client base and the amount of referred business.
- 2.4.6 Note: A person may be classified as having referred business even if a law firm does not pay that person a fee for the referrals.

## AA8 Number of persons who referred clients to the law firm during the data reporting period, analysed by country

- 2.4.7 Question AA8 requires the number of persons who referred clients to be analysed by country, using spreadsheet AE.
- 2.4.8 Please note:
- (a) the countries are listed on spreadsheet AE alphabetically; and
- (b) only positive responses are required i.e. there is no need to insert '0' against every country.

## AA9 Number of persons who referred clients to the law firm during the data reporting period, which carry on the following activities

- 2.4.9 Question AA9 requires analysis of the number recorded at AA8 between those that are:
- (a) Lawyers;
- (b) Accountants; and
- (c) Other, which includes any referrals from another group company or a trust company business.

- 2.4.10 Where a law firm responds that the majority of the persons that are referring clients fall in 'Other' (AA9(c)) please provide further details at AA15 (General comments on section AA). This may include referrals from existing clients.
- 2.4.11 If a law firm considers that it does not have any persons that refer business then please insert '0' into each of AA9(a), AA9(b) and AA9(c).
- AA10 Number of relationships with persons who referred clients to the law firm during the data reporting period that were terminated due to CDD issues, or other financial crime concerns
- 2.4.12 Question AA10 requires a law firm to record the number of times, during the data reporting period, that a relationship between them and a person who referred clients has been terminated, by either party, because of a CDD issue or other financial crime concern. For example, in a case where the person referring clients considers that CDD
- measures applied by the law firm are impractical or excessive.
- 2.4.13 If no terminations have occurred, please insert a '0' in response to AA10.

## 2.5 Cash transactions

## AA11 Number and value of cash transactions (i.e. notes and coins) for clients during the data reporting period (receipt or payment) in any jurisdiction

- 2.5.1 Question AA11 requests data about the number (AA11(a)) and value (AA11(b)) of cash transactions (using notes and coins ) conducted for clients.
- 2.5.2 This question is intended to determine the extent to which physical cash is still used in the legal sector. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not include bank transfers, cheques or any form of virtual currency transactions .
- 2.5.3 Whilst we recognise that the use of cash is minimal in the Jersey-based legal sector, it is important that this assumption is validated as cash transactions are a key risk indicator for money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
- 2.5.4 If no cash transactions occurred during the data reporting period, please insert '0' at both AA11(a) and AA11(b).

## 2.6 Transaction monitoring

- 2.6.1 Whilst it is understood that many transactions with a law firm will be 'one-off' it is also understood that some clients may have an ongoing relationship with a law firm.
- 2.6.2 Where an ongoing relationship is established transaction monitoring must be undertaken (Article 13 of the MLO).
- AA12 What is the timing of the ongoing monitoring of transactions during a client relationship? (Real-time ; Post-event ; Both ; N/A)
- AA13 Are monitoring procedures automatic or manual? (Automated ; Manual ; Both ; N/A)

## AA14 What rules are applied to the transaction monitoring procedures?

## (Generic ; Tailored ; Both ; N/A)

- 2.6.3 Questions AA12, AA13 and AA14 need only be answered in respect of clients with an ongoing relationship.
- 2.6.4 Where a law firm has no ongoing client relationships please respond to each of AA12, AA13 and AA14 with 'N/A'.

Guide to Section II of risk based supervision data: Lawyers

| Client type                    |   Number of clients |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Trusts with Jersey trustee     |                   1 |

- 3.2.4 Where a law firm has no clients of a particular type please insert '0'.
- 3.2.5 Please note the sum of AB1(i) to (viii) should equal the sum of AA1(a) to (c).

## 3.3 Enhanced CDD measures

- 3.3.1 Information regarding enhanced CDD measures can be found in Section 7 of the Legal Sector AML/CFT Handbook.
- 3.3.2 In addition to a law firm deciding that a client presents a higher risk of money laundering or financing terrorism, there are some circumstances where enhanced CDD measures are required by Articles 15,15A and 15B of the Money Laundering Order:
- (a) the client, or some other prescribed person, is a politically exposed person ( PEP ) (section 7.6)
- (b) the client has a 'relevant connection' to an 'enhanced risk state' (section 7.5)
- (c) the client is a company with nominee shareholders or issues bearer shares (section 7.10)
- (d) the client is a personal asset holding vehicle (section 7.9)
- (e) the client, or some other person, is not physically present for identification purpose (section 7.4)

trustee; (iv) Trusts with non-Jersey trustee; (v) Jersey companies; (vi) Non-Jersey companies; (vii) Other - Jersey; and (viii) Other - non-Jersey

- 3.3.3 Using the response to question AB1 as the base for responding, question AB2 requires data about the number of clients to which enhanced customer due diligence ( CDD ) measures have been applied.
- 3.3.4 For example, using the example laid out in 3.2.3, if 3 of the 10 clients that are reported as 'individuals - Jersey' have been subject to enhanced CDD measures then respond '3'.
- 3.3.5 If a law firm has no clients which have been subject to enhanced CDD measures then insert '0' in each orange box.

- 3.6.3 Where a transaction took place in a currency other than GBP (e.g. Euros) please convert the transaction value to GBP using the most appropriate exchange rate.
- 3.6.4 If no transactions passed through a client account during the data reporting period, please insert '0' at AB15 through to AB15(c).

## 4 Section AC - Beneficial ownership

## 4.1 General

- 4.1.2 Data in respect of using Article 18 is to be reported in response to question AD10 (Further exemptions from applying identification requirements (Article 18 of the MLO)).

## 4.2 Clients who are individuals and beneficial owners or controllers of clients that are not individuals

## AC1 Number and principal country of residence of:

(i) individuals who are clients; and (ii) individuals who are the beneficial owner or controller of a client that is not an individual

- 4.2.1 The principal country of residence of an individual who is a client, or the beneficial owners and controllers of clients who are not individuals, is recognised as a key factor in determining the riskiness of a client - section 3 of the Legal Sector AML/CFT Handbook provides further guidance.
- 4.2.2 The term 'beneficial ownership and control' is defined in Article 2 of the Money Laundering Order. It refers to the individuals who ultimately own or control a client that is a legal person iv .

## 4.2.6 Please Note :

Each individual should only be reported once.

The following are examples where an individual may have more than one relationship with a law firm but should only be reported once:

- (a) they are the beneficial owner or controller of more than one company; or
- (b) they are the beneficial owner or controller of a company and are also a client in their own right

## 4.3 Client acting on behalf of a third party

## AC2 Number and principal country of residence of third parties on whose behalf a client is acting

- 4.3.1 Question AC2 collects data on the principal country of residence of third parties on whose behalf a client acts.
- 4.3.2 For example, a legal arrangement cannot form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction itself. It is the trustee(s) of the trust or general partner(s) of the limited partnership who will enter into a business relationship or carry out the oneoff transaction with a law firm on behalf of the legal arrangement and who will be considered to be the client(s). In line with Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order, the trust or limited partnership will be considered to be the third party on whose behalf the trustee(s) or general partner(s) act(s).
- 4.3.3 In these cases the law firm should have identified the persons for whom the client is acting in line with Article 3(2) of the Money Laundering Order and the guidance provided in section 4 of the Legal Sector AML/CFT Handbook. For ease guidance has been provided below:
- (a) In a case where the third party is a legal person (e.g. a company), data should be provided on the individuals who are beneficial owner or controller of that legal person (Article 3(2)(b)(ii) of the Money Laundering Order).
- (b) In a case where a third party is a trust (other than a collective investment fund), data should be provided on:
- › the settlor v ;
- › the protector;
- › beneficiaries with a vested right;
- › other beneficiaries and persons who are the object of a power that have been identified as presenting a higher risk; and
- › any other person who exercises ultimate effective control over the trust (Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order).
- (c) In a case where a third party is a limited partnership (other than a collective investment fund), data should be provided on the limited partners (Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order).
- (d) In a case where a third party is a collective investment fund, data should be provided on any beneficial owners and controllers, i.e. individuals exercising control of the collective investment fund through ownership means, other means or through the position that they hold (see section 14.3.2 of the Regulated Financial Services Business AML/CFT Handbook (Funds and Fund Services Business)).

## 5 Section AD - Use and application of concessions granted by the Money Laundering Order

- (b) keeps the evidence of identity; and
- (c) will provide that evidence without delay if requested to do so.
- 5.3.4 In light of 5.3.3(c), question AD6 requires a law firm to report the number of obliged persons that failed to provide information and evidence on demand and without delay.
