
## Guidance Note: Definitions and Guidance on the Adjusted NET Liquid Assets (ANLA) Calculation

1 July 2014

## 1 Introduction

- 1.1 The purpose of this document is to provide definitions and guidance relating to a number of terms utilised in the Resource Requirement Calculation (also known as the ANLA calculation ).
- 1.2 The Schedules to the Code of Practice for Fund Services Business ( FSB Code ), Investment Business ( IB Code ) and Trust Company Business ( TCB Code ), as published by the Jersey Financial Services Commission (the JFSC ), contain the proforma ANLA calculation.

## 2 Scope of ANLA Calculation

- 2.1 In accordance with the FSB Code, IB Code and TCB Code the ANLA calculation must be completed by all registered persons except:
- 2.1.1 a registered person that is a managed fund services business providing services to qualifying funds, in which case paragraph 5.1.3 of the FSB Code is relevant; a registered person must have and maintain financial resources which are, in the opinion of its directors, sufficient to meet its commitments;
- 2.1.2 registered persons that have been granted a registration to carry on deposit-taking business ( banks ) (see also paragraph 2.2);
- 2.1.3 where the JFSC has consented, a trust company business that is 100% owned by a Jersey Bank (a Jersey incorporated company registered to carry on deposit-taking business) (see also paragraph 2.3); and
- 2.1.4 trust company businesses that are part of an affiliation and are able to take advantage of paragraph 5.1.7 of the TCB Code.
- 2.2 All banks, both Jersey Banks and Jersey Branches (a branch in Jersey of a company incorporated overseas that is registered to carry on deposit-taking business in Jersey), are required to provide the JFSC with quarterly prudential reports which provide comprehensive financial information.  Consequently, the JFSC does not require these registered persons to complete an ANLA calculation.
- 2.3 As provided at paragraph 5.1.3 of the TCB Code, where a trust company business is 100% owned by a Jersey Bank, it may apply to the JFSC, in writing, for a variance (exemption) from completing the ANLA calculation.  Such a variance will only be considered if the Jersey Bank has provided a letter of undertaking, acceptable to the JFSC, in respect of providing financial support to the trust company business.
- 2.4 The ANLA calculation is to be undertaken in respect of the financial position of a registered person as a whole, rather than a particular business line.  Consequently, in the majority of cases, a registered person that holds more than one registration, which requires the

completion of an ANLA calculation, for example, fund services business and trust company business, is only required to complete one ANLA calculation.  The ANLA calculation should reflect the most prudent circumstances.

- 2.5 However, to be clear, where a registered person carries on fund services business and is a trust company business participating member, an ANLA calculation should be completed.  This requirement does not affect the ability of the affiliation from taking advantage of paragraph 5.1.7 of the TCB Code.
- 2.6 Where the registered person operates in Jersey through a branch, the financial information to be included in the ANLA calculation should be taken from either the most recent management accounts or the audited financial statements of the registered person, as determined in section 5, i.e. the financial information should not only be in respect of the Jersey Branch.
- 2.7 Section 5 assists registered persons with more than one registration by identifying those items which are not common across the ANLA calculation of the FSB Code, IB Code and TCB Code.

## 3 Frequency of ANLA Calculation

- 3.1 In accordance with the FSB Code, IB Code and TCB Code, registered persons must complete an ANLA calculation as appropriate to the nature of the business, but at least on a quarterly basis.
- 3.2 The FSB Code, IB Code and TCB Code include specific circumstances where the frequency of the ANLA calculation is greater than quarterly:
- 3.2.1 All three Code require that the ANLA calculation is undertaken on at least a monthly basis, if it is not already being completed on a more frequent basis, where:
- 3.2.1.1 a registered person's ANLA position is either between 130% and 110%, or
- 3.2.1.2 an event out of the ordinary course of business occurs which has a material adverse effect on the registered person's financial position.
- 3.2.2 Paragraph 5.1.6 of the IB Code requires a person registered to carry on investment business that has position, counterparty or foreign currency risk exposures to complete its ANLA calculation on a daily basis.  The JFSC will consider a variance to the daily ANLA calculation if the registered person can demonstrate either enhanced capitalisation or that it regularly exceeds the requirement to a sufficient extent suggesting that the risk of an ANLA breach is minimal.  If granted, such a variance will be conditional on these circumstances being maintained.
- 3.2.3 Paragraph 5.1.8 of the FSB Code requires a person registered to carry on fund services business which has one or more of position, counterparty or foreign currency risk to approach the JFSC for guidance regarding the impact of the risk(s) on its financial resources calculation.  Each case will be considered on its own merits, however the FSB Code highlight that the JFSC anticipates that the registered person will need to complete the financial resource calculation on a monthly basis.

## 4 Financial Resources Notification

- 4.1 If a registered person submits a notification to the JFSC that its ANLA is less than 110% of its Expenditure Requirement, it is the JFSC's expectation that the registered person will have a

documented plan for restoring its financial resources position such that it is compliant with the Code.

- 4.2 Given the importance of financial resources, the JFSC will, in the majority of cases, require the registered person to submit its restoration plan to the JFSC within 30 days of having made its financial resource notification.
- 4.3 Where it deems it appropriate, the JFSC may impose conditions, financial or otherwise, on a registered person whilst it restores its financial resources position.

## 5 Table of definitions and guidance in relation to the basic ANLA calculation

- 5.1 The following items are mostly relevant for the basic ANLA calculation as established in the FSB Code, IB Code and TCB Code.

The WIP balance may fluctuate due to a registered person's position in its billing cycle.  However, a registered  person should be able to demonstrate that any WIP, which is not adjusted out of the Total Assets, can be both  billed and collected within 90 calendar days. The liquidity of WIP is interlinked with that of debtors consequently, a registered person should assess them in  conjunction.  For example, where a fee debtor is deemed illiquid, as it has not been recovered within 90  calendar days, it is unlikely that any WIP in respect of that same customer can be considered liquid. |

However, where a registered person pays certain expenses on behalf of another company and the balance is  regularly settled by way of intercompany payment, this related party debtor may be treated as liquid if it is  settled within 60 calendar days in the normal course of business. Where a registered person makes a loan to a related party, this is typically not considered liquid, even if it could  be recovered within 60 calendar days if necessary, as this would not be in the normal course of business.   |

There is therefore a risk that a single claim will not emerge in  isolation but will rather form part of a series of similar claims. This adjustment does not apply where a registered person only carries on fund services business as the FSB  Code do not specify a maximum permitted level of PII excess, rather the responsibility for determining the  appropriate level of PII cover and excess is placed on the Board of the registered person.                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11.      | Guarantees  and/or charges  over assets |   |   |   | Where there is a charge, or the registered person has entered into a guarantee arrangement, relating to any  asset within Adjusted Total Assets then an appropriate adjustment must be made to increase Total Liabilities  thus reducing the ANLA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 12.      | Provision for  Clawback                 |    |   |    | This figure must be an appropriate estimate of the anticipated clawback that the registered person may suffer in  the year, based on available information such as persistency rates, if such an accrual has not already been  included within Total Liabilities (e.g. as part of trade creditors and accruals).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 13.      | Non-refundable  deferred  income        |   |   |   | Where a registered person undertakes billing of fixed fees in advance, the Total Liabilities figure will include  deferred income, which will be released to profit and loss over the period to which the bill relates.   For registered persons undertaking fund services business or investment business, where it is clearly stated in  the registered person's terms and conditions/client agreement that the fee is non-refundable, deferred income  may be deducted from the Total Liabilities figure thereby increasing the overall adjusted net liquid assets figure.   However, if the terms and conditions/client agreement are silent on this matter, or permit a repayment of fees  collected in advance, then the deferred income creditor may not be deducted. |
| deferred | Non-refundable  income (cont'd)         |   |   |   | For registered persons undertaking trust company business, the JFSC recognises that it is industry standard for  fees billed in advance not to be refundable consequently all deferred income can be deducted from the total  liabilities figure. At the point of billing (especially if an element of billing is undertaken annually), the impact of the deferred  income adjustment may be to produce the registered person's most favourable ANLA position of the year.  It is  therefore important that a registered person considers the impact of deferred income on their ANLA position  and on their ability to meet the financial resource requirements throughout the year.                                                                                        |
| 14.   | Allowable  subordinated  loans > 1 year         |    |    |    | Where the JFSC has granted a variance in respect of the treatment of a subordinated loan in the ANLA  calculation, the outstanding balance of the subordinated loan may be deducted from Total Liabilities, subject to  the following: › The amount deducted may not exceed four times the net asset position of the registered person,  calculated using the registered person's latest audited financial statements. › The JFSC's consent to vary the subordinated loan treatment in the ANLA will fall away if either: › the registered person fails to comply with any of the requirements of the subordinated loan  agreement, including the notification requirements; or › the subordinated loan repayment date falls due within one year.   |
| 15.   | Allowable  undrawn credit  facilities           |    |    |    | An undrawn credit facility is allowable as an adjustment to Total Liabilities within the ANLA calculation, with the  written consent of the JFSC.  Such consent will generally be granted when a registered person anticipates a  short-term liquidity problem arising in exceptional circumstances, as the adjustment will reduce the total  liabilities figure. Exceptional circumstances that may give rise to such consent are: › The registered person anticipates a future liquidity shortfall and is seeking to recognise the undrawn  credit facility in its ANLA calculation pending implementation of an agreed plan to maintain compliance  with the financial resource requirements.                                                    |
|       | Allowable  undrawn credit  facilities  (cont'd) |    |    |    | › The registered person has encountered an unforeseen cash outflow that has resulted in a breach of the  financial resource requirement (below 110%) and is formulating measures to address the breach.  As a  short term measure however, the undrawn credit facility is required. In considering whether to grant consent the JFSC will assess: › the extent of the actual breach or anticipated position;  › the registered person's track record of compliance with the financial resource requirements;  › the purpose and terms of the facility; and  › the stature of the lender.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 16.   | Other expenses                            |    |    |    | Where the registered person forms part of a larger group, it is common for a management charge to be made  between the registered person and a related party.  The charge often comprises an element of expenditure that  has been borne by the related party, particularly where the related party is a service company which recharges  an element of shared costs, such as rent or insurance, back to the registered person.  The JFSC's expectation is that within the ANLA calculation, the expenditure requirement of the registered  person should include that element of costs, which is reflected within the management charge or borne by a  related party in respect of the registered person.  This is because the registered person would have to incur  these costs in their own right if they were not part of a larger group. Any management charges and payments to related parties should be included within the 'other expenses'  section of the total actual expenditure calculation.   |
| 17.   | Total actual  expenditure                 |    |    |    | For the majority of the year, the total actual expenditure should agree to the latest audited financial  statements.  However, following this approach there is a period of up to four months at the start of the financial  year when this information reflects a position that is anything up to 16 months old i.e. the calculation of 31  March 2013 would be utilising information as at 31 December 2011, assuming a December year-end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|       | Total actual  expenditure (cont'd)        |     |     |     | Consequently, during this four-month period, a registered person should consider the actual unaudited  expenditure of the financial year just gone.  If this figure is higher than the expenditure recorded in the latest  audited financial statements then the unaudited expenditure should be utilised in the calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 18.   | Adjustments to  total actual  expenditure |    |    |    | No amendment may be made to the total actual expenditure figure for either taxation or depreciation. Whilst not a cashflow movement, depreciation reflects the impact of purchasing the fixed assets appropriate to  the ongoing operation of the registered person's business.  Depreciation is therefore an effective mechanism for  ensuring on an ongoing basis that the cashflow impact of fixed asset purchases is appropriately included on a  consistent basis in the ANLA calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 19.   | Discretionary  bonuses/profit  share      |    |    |    | This adjustment may only be applied where the payments are non-contractual and wholly discretionary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|   20. | Exceptional  costs                              |    |    |    | Total actual expenditure may be adjusted for any exceptional costs providing the JFSC has given its written  consent. Exceptional costs are incurred outside of the day-to-day activities of the registered person and are not expected  to recur.  Examples would include restructuring costs, asset write downs, profit or loss on disposal of assets and  investments and discontinuing operations. Where the JFSC is satisfied that the expenditure is exceptional, it may consider consenting to the exclusion of  the expense from total actual expenditure in calculating the registered person's expenditure requirement.  Any  forecast exceptional expenditure may not, however, be excluded from total budgeted expenditure as this would  not be a prudent methodology. Amounts payable in respect of litigation may be considered to be exceptional once the litigation has been  concluded and related legal fees and settlement amounts due have been physically paid.  In considering  consent, the JFSC will seek to be satisfied that the litigation does not form part of a wider trend and that there  are no similar cases pending.   |
|    21 | Other  adjustment to  total actual  expenditure |    |    |    | Where a management charge or payment to a related party includes an element of profit, which is not made on  a contracted basis, an adjustment may be undertaken to the total actual expenditure to exclude this element, as  this could distort the expenditure requirement and have an adverse effect on the ANLA calculation. Conversely, where expenses are borne by a related party (e.g. parent or service company within the group) and  no, or minimal, management charge is applied, the JFSC expects this position to be rectified by an appropriate  apportionment of costs being included within the registered person's ANLA calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|    22 | Budgeted  expenditure                           |    |    |    | This figure must be based on the business plan budget for the year in question.  During the year, the figure  should be flexed if it becomes apparent that actual expenditure is forecast to be materially different than  budgeted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## 6 Table of definitions and guidance in relation to the technical elements of the investment business ANLA calculation

- 6.1 The IB Code place additional requirements on registered persons holding an investment business registration in the form of the position risk requirement ( PRR ), counterparty risk requirement ( CRR ) and foreign currency risk requirement ( FCRR ) therefore the following items are predominately relevant for the ANLA calculation as established in the IB Code.
- 6.2 However, paragraph 5.1.8 of the FSB Code recognises that PRR, CRR and FCRR may also be a feature of a fund services business.  Where this is the case, the FSB Code require the registered person to approach the JFSC for guidance on the adjustment(s) to their financial resource calculation.  The calculation of any adjustment will follow the methodology relevant to investment businesses therefore the following might also be of interest to some fund services businesses.
- 6.3 The requirements aim to mitigate the associated risks, which can be broadly summarised as:
- 6.3.1 position risk - the risk arising from adverse changes in general market conditions;
- 6.3.2 counterparty risk - the risk that a counterparty will not live up to its contractual obligations; and
- 6.3.3 foreign currency risk - risk arising from changes in currency rates.
