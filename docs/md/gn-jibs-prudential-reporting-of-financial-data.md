## 1 Overview

## Introduction

- 1.1 The 'Financial' data sheets are designed to provide the JFSC with an assessment of a JIB's balance sheet / off-balance sheet activities and its profit and loss.
- 1.2 This Guide addresses the completion of the following sheets:
- 1.2.1 '2.1 BS Assets' and'2.3 BS Liabilities': data is entered that describes the make-up of the JIB's balance sheet.
- 1.2.2 '2.2 Credit Summary': derived from data in the sheet '2.1 BS Sheet Assets' to provide a summary by appropriate credit categories.
- 1.2.3 '2.4 Off-Balance Sheet': data is entered to describe the extent and nature of offbalance sheet activities.
- 1.2.4 '2.5 Profit and Loss': data is entered to describe the profit and loss to date for the current year.
- 1.3 Throughout, areas where data should be inputted are indicated visually in the sheets by the use of white boxes - no data should be entered elsewhere and every box should be completed, entering zero where appropriate.

## 2 '2.1 BS Assets'

## Categorisation

- 2.1 The reporting institution should categorise balance sheet assets by column according to:
- 2.1.1 Banking Book assets - the approach used to determine credit risk (Standardised Approach, F-IRB or A-IRB); or
- 2.1.2 Trading Book assets - 'Trading Book' column only;
- 2.2 For each row, the figure in the 'Total' column is calculated as the sum of all inputs in that row. The only exception to this is that for items that fall into Credit Portfolio K (Capital Ratios Treatment) only the total amount should be input in the 'Total' column.
- 2.3 Assets should be further categorised by row according to the table below.
- 2.4 To the right of the input area, applicable Credit Portfolio references are quoted for each row  these are used to summarise the balance sheet - see Section 3 .
- 2.5 The designation of an asset as marketable has the following meaning:
- 2.5.1 Prices are regularly quoted for the asset;
- 2.5.2 The asset is regularly traded;
- 2.5.3 The asset is readily sold, including by repo, either on an exchange, or in a deep and liquid market, for payment in cash; and
- 2.5.4 Settlement is made according to a prescribed timetable, rather than a negotiated timetable.
- 2.6 'Past due' assets are reported in F.3, rather than according to the normal classification. Assets must be classified as 'Past due' after 90 days have passed since a payment is missed.

## 5 Off-balance sheet exposures

## Categorisation

- 5.1 The reporting institution should categorise off-balance sheet exposures by column according to the following:
- 5.1.1 Banking Book exposures should be categorised according to the approach that is used for credit risk (Standardised Approach, FIRB and AIRB); or
- 5.1.2 Trading Book exposures should only be reported under the column 'Trading Book'
- 5.2 For each row, the figure in the Total column is calculated as the sum of all inputs for that row.
- 5.3 The only exception to this is that for exposures that would ordinarily fall within Items A.1 to A.11 but require capital treatment. These should be omitted from the relevant category and instead reported in A.12 to A.14, and then only in the 'Total' column.
- 5.4 Exposures should be categorised by row according to the table below.
- 5.5 The sheet calculates the total exposure of the bank to each type of exposure and other subtotals as shown in the table. Note that for the Standardised Approach, the total exposures shown should agree to the total amounts reported within portfolios M, N and P in the sheet '3.9 SAC summary'.

| A.1    | Direct Credit Substitutes.  Direct credit substitutes almost always relate to the financial wellbeing of  a third party. In this case, the risk of loss to the reporting institution from the transaction is  equivalent to a direct claim on that party, i.e. the risk of loss depends on the creditworthiness of the  third party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| A.2    | Transaction Related Contingencies.  Transaction related contingents relate to the ongoing trading  activities of a counterparty where the risk of loss to the reporting institution depends on the  likelihood of a future event that is independent of the creditworthiness of the counterparty. They  are essentially guarantees that support particular financial obligations, rather than supporting  customers' general financial obligations.                                                                                                                   |
| A.3    | Trade Related Contingencies.  These comprise short-term, self-liquidating trade related items, such  as documentary letters of credit issued by the reporting institution, which are, or are to be,  collateralised by the underlying shipment, i.e. where the credit provides for the reporting institution  to retain title to the underlying shipment. Such items should be weighted according to the  counterparty on whose behalf the credit is issued whether or not the terms and conditions of the  credit have yet to be complied with.                      |
| A.4    | Asset sales with recourse.  Asset sales with recourse (where the credit risk remains with the bank)  fall into the weighting category determined by the asset and not the counterparty with whom the  transaction has been entered into.  Put options written where the holder of the asset is entitled to put the asset back to the reporting  institution,  e.g.  if  the  credit  quality  deteriorates,  should  be  reported  here,  as  should  put  options  written by the reporting institution attached to marketable instruments or other physical assets. |

| A.7             | Forward deposits placed.  These comprise commitments to place deposits in the future.  Where the reporting institution has instead contracted to receive the deposit, failure to deliver by  the counterparty will result in an unanticipated change in its interest rate exposure and may involve  a replacement cost. Such exposures should therefore be treated as interest rate contracts (see Item  B.1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| A.8             | Note Issuance and Revolving Underwriting Facilities.  Note issuance facilities and revolving  underwriting facilities should include the total amounts of the reporting institution's underwriting  obligations of any maturity. Where the facility has been drawn down by the borrower and the notes  are held by anyone other than the reporting institution, the underwriting obligation should continue  to be reported at the full nominal amount.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| A.9   and  A.10 | Other commitments split into those with original maturity of less than 1 year (A.9) and 1 year or  over (A.10).  The JIB is regarded as having a commitment from the date the customer is advised of  the facility (e.g. the date of the letter advising the customer), regardless of whether the  commitment is revocable or irrevocable, conditional or unconditional and in particular whether or  not the facility contains a 'material adverse change' clause.  Facilities subject to annual review  should only be classified within A.9, rather than A.10, if the bank is confident there is no client  expectation of automatic renewal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| A.11            | Commitments that are unconditionally cancellable without prior notice.  Commitments (including  the undrawn portion of any binding arrangements which obligate the reporting institution to  provide funds at some future date) that are unconditionally cancellable without prior notice other  than for 'force majeure' reason, or that effectively provide for automatic cancellation due to  deterioration in a borrower's creditworthiness. This also includes any revolving or undated/open- ended commitments, e.g. overdrafts or unused credit card lines, provided that they can be  unconditionally cancelled at any time and are subject to credit review at least annually. Facilities  should only be classified here, rather than in A.9/10, if the bank is confident that the client is aware  of both the review process and has confirmed that the facility may be withdrawn at any time. |
| A.12            | Any  of  the  above  exposures  that  require  capital  treatment:  Securitisation.  Off  balance  sheet  exposures reported in A.1 to A.11 where the exposure relates to equity tranches of securitisations,  where an on-balance sheet exposure fall within Credit Portfolio K.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## 6 Profit and loss account

- 6.1 Sheet '2.5 Profit &amp; Loss' should be completed to detail the JIB's Profit and Loss Account for the current financial year up to the reporting date.
- 6.2 When reporting income, a positive figure should be input for an amount that gives rise to a profit and a negative item for a loss. The sole exception to this is A.1.1.2 where the absolute amount of the interest expense should be entered.
- 6.3 For Operating Expenses, Bad debts, Extraordinary Items, Taxation and Dividends, the assumption is that all these items are expenses and hence a positive figure should be entered for an amount that gives rise to a loss and a negative figure for a profit.
