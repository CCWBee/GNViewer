## Table of Contents

## 1 General guidance

## 1.1 Scope

- 1.1.1 This guidance document relates to Section II of the 2023 risk based supervision data collection which requires the provision of activity based data from Reporting Entities registered to carry on lending services.
- 1.1.2 Lending is a financial services business activity as set out in Schedule 2 to the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999, specifically paragraph 3 of Part 2 of Schedule 2:

## Lending

- (1)     Lending.
- (2)     Sub-paragraph (1) includes inter alia: consumer credit, mortgage credit, factoring, with or without recourse; and  finance of  commercial transactions (including forfeiting).

## 1.2 Excel workbook

- 1.2.1 The Excel workbook for a reporting entity carrying on lending services comprises 5 spreadsheets, as follows:
- (a) EA - Compliance Data
- (b)
- EB - Customer Data
- (c) EC - Beneficial Ownership
- (d) ED - Use and application of concessions granted by the MLO i
- (e) EE - Country List
- 1.2.2 Spreadsheet EE is an input sheet for the responses to questions EA6, EC1, EC2, ED3 and ED7.

## 1.3 Customers

- 1.3.1 The spreadsheets require lenders to provide data in respect of their customers.
- 1.3.2 A customer is a person to whom the lender provides lending services as described in 1.1.2 above.

## 1.4 Data reporting period

- 1.4.1 Generally, data should be provided for the period 1/1/2023 to 31/12/2023.
- 1.4.2 There are a few data items where the data should be provided as at the end of the reporting period (31/12/2023 or closest business day).

## 1.5 Data Submission

- 1.5.1 Lenders are recommended to consider the data request as soon as possible. It may take some time to gather the data requested and the deadline for submission is 17:00 on 31 May 2024 .

- 1.5.2 Each lender will be submitting a completed Excel Workbook for Section II through the JFSC Portal, and each lender has a designated individual who is the JFSC Portal contact, which, in the vast majority of cases, is the money laundering compliance officer.
- 1.5.3 Notwithstanding that the JFSC Portal contact has responsibility for submitting the data, the board, or equivalent, of the lender should have oversight of the content of the submission made on their behalf.
- 1.5.1 For many this will be the sixth time the data return has been completed therefore the JFSC expects lenders to be in a very good position to report their 2023 data and that only on a very exceptional basis will responses need to be derived by extrapolation or estimates supported by specific criteria.
- 1.5.1 Where a lender needs to extrapolate or estimate its data as system changes are being implemented, the comments section at the bottom of the relevant spreadsheet should highlight which data elements have been impacted, the extent they have been impacted and when the relevant system changes will take effect.
- 1.5.2 Where the lender feels it necessary to provide additional data to enable the JFSC to understand the response, this information should also be included in the comments section at the bottom of each relevant spreadsheet.
- 1.5.3 With the exception of spreadsheet EE-Lenders-Country list , all parts of each question should be answered. Consequently, please insert a '0' where relevant.
- 1.5.4 Where a balance is denominated in a currency other than GBP (e.g. Euros) please convert the transaction value to GBP using the most appropriate exchange rate.

## 1.6 Integrity checking your submission

- 1.6.1 Before submitting your data the JFSC suggests that the integrity checks highlighted in paragraphs 1.6.2 to 1.6.8 should be completed.
- 1.6.2 Sum of EA1(a) to (c) needs to agree to the sum of EB1(a)(i) to (viii).
- 1.6.3 EA1(a) should equal sum of EB3(a)(i) to (viii)
- 1.6.4 The number (EB2(a)) and value (EB2(b)) responses should not exceed those provided in EB1(a) and EB1(b) respectively, in any given column.
- 1.6.5 The number and value responses in EB3 to EB11 cannot be individually greater than those provided in EB2(a) and EB2(b) respectively, in any column.
- 1.6.6 The number and value responses in EB11 should not exceed those provided in EB9 or EB10, in any given column.
- 1.6.7 The number and value responses in EB11 should not exceed those provided in EB4.
- 1.6.8 ED10(a) should equal the sum of ED10(b) to (f)

## 2 Section EA - Lenders compliance data

## 2.1 Overview

- 2.1.1 This section collects data on:
- (a) customer risk ratings;
- (b) business which has been declined, terminated or withdrawn due to customer due diligence or other financial crime concerns;
- (c) referred business (the extent to which customers are obtained on the basis of referrals from other businesses); and
- (d) cash transactions (the extent to which cash is used).

## 2.2 Risk Rating

- EA1 Number of customers in each category of risk (as defined by the lender) during the data reporting period
- (a) higher; (b) standard; (c) lower
- EA2 Do the lender's risk ratings include factors other than money laundering and the financing of terrorism?

(Yes ; No) If yes, please provide details at EA13(a)

- 2.2.1 Question EA1 requests data about the number of customers that have been assessed as presenting (a) higher, (b) standard or (c) lower ML/TF risk (on the basis of factors set out in section 3.3.4 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook).
- 2.2.2 Where use is made of a more precise risk scoring scale, it will be necessary to determine which categories in that scale approximate to higher ii , standard or lower risk. For example, if a lender measures risk on a score of 1 to 10, it may consider anything between 1 and 3 to present a lower risk, 4 to 7 to present a standard risk, and 8 to 10 to present a higher risk.
- 2.2.3 If a lender includes other factors e.g. commercial risk, in its risk rating of customers and the ML/TF risk element cannot be reported separately, please report the combined risk rating.
- 2.2.4 If a combined rating is reported please select 'yes' when responding to EA2 .
- 2.2.5
- Please provide an answer for every element of EA1. For example a lender with zero higher risk, 4 medium risk and 6 lower risk customers

and who only considers money laundering and terrorist financing when risk rating a customer, should complete the fields as follows:

| EA1(a) - Higher   | 0                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| EA1(b) - Medium   | 4                             |
| EA1(c) - Lower    | 6                             |
| EA2               | Choose 'No' from the dropdown |

- 2.2.1 Please note the sum of EA1(a) to (c) should equal the sum of EB1(a)(i) to (viii).

## 2.3 Declined, terminated and withdrawn business

- EA3 Number of applications from prospective customers to either (i) establish a customer relationship, or (ii) carry out a one-off transaction, declined due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns, during the data reporting period

## EA4 Number of customer relationships terminated, due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns, during the data reporting period

- 2.3.1 In line with Section 2.4.1 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook (paragraph 33), questions EA3 and EA4 request data about:
- (a) the number of prospective customer relationships or one-off transactions that have been declined ( EA3 ); and
- (b) customer relationships that have been terminated due to CDD issues or other financial crime concerns ( EA4 ).

This will include cases where:

- › it has not been possible to complete identification measures (before or during a customer relationship) under the Money Laundering Order, including establishing the source of funds;
- › the ML/TF risk has been assessed as being too high (and so outside the lender's risk appetite); and
- › there is suspicion of ML/TF.
- 2.3.2 This question applies also to cases where:
- (a) an application to form a customer relationship or carry out a one-off transaction is handled by a third party, e.g. a lawyer, and where there is no direct contact with the prospective customer; and
- (b) an application to form a customer relationship or carry out a one-off transaction has not yet been formally submitted, e.g. where CDD is applied at the time that business is being solicited (where this data is recorded).
- 2.3.3 Please do not leave fields blank, insert a '0' in EA3 and EA4 if no prospective customers have been declined or customers terminated.

## EA5 Number of applications from prospective customers who have withdrawn due to CDD issues, during the data reporting period (where this data is collected)

- 2.3.4 Question EA5 collects data on customer applications withdrawn solely or partly on the basis of CDD requested.
- 2.3.5 It is recognised that this data may not be recorded by a lender. If this is the case please respond with '0'. Do not leave the field blank.
- 2.3.6 This question also applies to cases where an application to form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction is handled by a third party, e.g. a lawyer, and where there is no direct contact with the prospective customer.

## 2.4 Referred business

- 2.4.1 Questions EA6, EA7 and EA8 request data about those persons who referred customers to a lender during the data reporting period.
- 2.4.1 Where business is referred to a lender but neither a one-off transaction nor customer relationship result this is not considered referred business for the purpose of responding to EA6, EA7 and EA8.

Guide to Section II of risk based supervision data:

- 2.4.2 Persons who refer customers to a lender may be third parties such as lawyers, accountants and trust company businesses.
- 2.4.3
- Additionally, if a lender is part of a group, any referrals from group companies or other branches of the same company should be included here. For example, if a Jersey lender is part of a group/company that has a Guernsey
- company/branch then referrals from the Guernsey operation should be reported.
- 2.4.4 The following should not be reported as persons who refer customers:
- (a) a third party or group entity that acts as an obliged person under Articles 16 or 16A of the Money Laundering Order (data on these persons is collected through spreadsheet ED (Use of MLO concessions)); or
- (b) a customer acting on behalf of one or more third parties (data on these persons is collected through spreadsheet EC (3 rd  party and beneficial ownership)) ; or
- (c) a person who refers customers on a basis that cannot be considered regular. The meaning of regular will vary by lender and will depend on a number of factors such as the size of their current customer base and the amount of referred business.
- 2.4.5 Note: A person may be classified as having referred business even if a lender does not pay that person a fee for the referrals.

## EA6 Number of persons who referred customers to the lender during the data reporting period, analysed by country

- 2.4.6 Question EA6 requires the number of persons who referred customers to be analysed by country, using spreadsheet EE.
- 2.4.7 Please note:
- (a) the countries are listed on spreadsheet EE alphabetically; and
- (b) only positive responses are required i.e. there is no need to insert '0' against every country.

## EA7 Number of persons who referred customers to the lender during the data reporting period, which carry on the following activities (a) lawyer; (b) accountant; (c) other

- 2.4.8 Question EA7 requires analysis of the number recorded at EA6.
- 2.4.9 Where a lender responds that the majority of the persons that are referring customers fall in 'Other' (EA7(c)) please provide further details at EA13 (General comments on section EA). This may include referrals from existing customers, another group company or a trust company business.
- 2.4.10 If a lender considers that it does not have any persons that refer business then please insert '0' into each of EA7(a), EA7(b) and EA7(c).

## EA8 Number of relationships with persons who referred customers to the lender during the data reporting period that were terminated due to CDD issues, or other financial crime concerns

- 2.5.1 Question EA9 requests data about the number (EA9(a)) and value (EA9(b)) of cash transactions (using notes and coins ) conducted for customers.
- 2.5.2 This question is intended to determine the extent to which physical cash is still used in the lending sector. For the avoidance of doubt, this does not include bank transfers, cheques or any form of virtual currency transactions.
- 2.5.3 Whilst we recognise that the use of cash may be minimal in the Jersey-based lending sector, it is important that this assumption is validated as cash transactions are a key risk indicator for money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
- 2.5.4 If no cash transactions occurred during the data reporting period, please insert '0' at both EA91(a) and EA9(b).

## 2.6 Transaction monitoring

- EA11 Are monitoring procedures automatic or manual? (Automated ; Manual ; Both ; N/A)

EA12

What rules are applied to the transaction monitoring procedures?

(Generic ; Tailored ; Both ; N/A)

- 2.6.1 Questions EA10 , EA11 and EA12 ask about transaction monitoring procedures.
- 2.6.2 In line with paragraph 16 of section 6.2.1 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook, where a lender's customer base is homogeneous, and where the products and services provided to customers result in uniform patterns of transactions or activity, it will be more straightforward to establish parameters to identify usual transactions and unusual activity. However, where each customer is unique, and where the product or service provided is bespoke, a lender will need to tailor monitoring systems to the nature of its business and facilitate the application of additional judgement and experience to the recognition of unusual transactions and activity.
- 2.6.3 Please answer each question.

## 2.7 General Comments

## EA13 Please provide any explanations or context comments below

- 2.7.1 If a lender selects 'yes' when responding to EA2 details of the other factors included in the combined risk rating should be provided at EA13(a).

- 3.3.4 For example, using the example laid out in 3.2.3, if 3 of the 10 customers that are reported as 'individuals - Jersey' have been subject to enhanced CDD measures then respond '3'.
- 3.3.5 Enhanced due diligence data in your workbooks should be provided in line with the requirements of the MLO . If enhanced due diligence is undertaken as standard on non-Jersey customers then all customers where standard CDD checks are applied should be reported as having been subject to enhanced due diligence. The data needs to accurately reflect the application of enhanced due diligence as defined in the MLO. If there is a significant difference between the number of customers who have enhanced due diligence applied to them and the number of non- Jersey-based customers, then please be ready to explain the difference.

## 4.2.6 Please Note :

Each individual should only be reported once.

The following are examples where an individual may have more than one relationship with a lender but should only be reported once:

- (a) they are the beneficial owner or controller of more than one company; or
- (b) they are the beneficial owner or controller of a company and are also a customer in their own right

## 4.3 Customer acting on behalf of a third party

## EC2 Number and principal country of residence of third parties on whose behalf a customer is acting

- 4.3.1 Question EC2 collects data on the principal country of residence of third parties on whose behalf a customer acts.

- 4.3.2 For example, a legal arrangement cannot form a business relationship or carry out a one-off transaction itself. It is the trustee(s) of the trust or general partner(s) of the limited partnership who will enter into a business relationship or carry out the oneoff transaction with a lender on behalf of the legal arrangement and who will be considered to be the customer(s). In line with Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order, the trust or limited partnership will be considered to be the third party on whose behalf the trustee(s) or general partner(s) act(s).
- 4.3.3 In these cases the lender should have identified the persons for whom the customer is acting in line with Article 3(2) of the Money Laundering Order and the guidance provided in section 4 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook. For ease guidance has been provided below:
- (a) In a case where the third party is a legal person (e.g. a company), data should be provided on the individuals who are beneficial owner or controller of that legal person (Article 3(2)(b)(ii) of the Money Laundering Order).
- (b) In a case where a third party is a trust (other than a collective investment fund), data should be provided on:
- › the settlor iv ;
- › the protector;
- › beneficiaries with a vested right;
- › other beneficiaries and persons who are the object of a power that have been identified as presenting a higher risk; and
- › any other person who exercises ultimate effective control over the trust (Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order).
- (c) In a case where a third party is a limited partnership (other than a collective investment fund), data should be provided on the limited partners (Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order).
- (d) In a case where a third party is a collective investment fund, data should be provided on any beneficial owners and controllers, i.e. individuals exercising control of the collective investment fund through ownership means, other means or through the position that they hold (see section 14.3.2 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook (section 14 specifically addresses Funds and Fund Services Business)).

## 4.4 General comments on responses provided above

Guide to Section II of risk based supervision data:

## 5.2 Customer identification and verification

- ED1 Number of customers, as at the end of the data reporting period, where identity has not yet been verified as the relationship started before February 2008 and Article 13(2) of the MLO is being relied upon
- 5.2.1 Article 13(2) of the Money Laundering Order provides for the timing of identification measures for the existing customers of a lender at the time the Money Laundering Order came into force - 4 February 2008.
- 5.2.2 Article 13(2) sets out very particular circumstances which enabled a lender to delay verification of a customer's identity - section 4.7.2 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook provides further guidance.
- 5.2.3 A lender should have finalised the position of its existing customers by 31 December 2014, unless a later date has been agreed by the JFSC (paragraphs 208 and 209 of section 4.7.2 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook). Consequently, it is expected that most lenders will report '0' in respect of ED1 .

## ED2 Number of customers where delayed verification in line with Article 13(4) of the MLO was applied during the data reporting period

- 5.2.4 In accordance with Article 13(4) of the Money Laundering Order a lender is permitted to delay verifying the identity of customer where (finding out the identity of the customer must not be delayed):
- (a) it is necessary not to interrupt the normal course of business;
- (b) there is little risk of money laundering or financing of terrorism occurring as a result of obtaining evidence of identity after establishing the relationship; and
- (c) evidence of identity is obtained as soon as reasonably practicable.
- 5.2.5 Question ED2 collects data about the number of customers where delayed verification in line with Article 13(4) of the Money Laundering Order has been applied.
- 5.2.6 If a lender has not delayed the verification of any customer's identity during the data reporting period, please respond with '0'.

## 5.3 Reliance on obliged persons (Article 16 of the MLO)

- 5.3.1 In line with Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order, reliance may be placed on an obliged person only where the six conditions, explained in section 5.1 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook, are met. In practice, this has the effect of:
- (a) limiting the number of obliged persons that can be relied upon; and
- (b) requiring the basis for placing reliance to be recorded in writing.
- ED3 Number of customers where reliance has been placed on obliged persons during the data reporting period
- ED4 Number of obliged persons on which reliance was placed, by country, as at the end of the data reporting period
- ED5 Number of obliged person(s) carrying on financial services business or equivalent business, relied upon as at the end of the data reporting period (i) financial services business; (ii) equivalent business
- (a) deposit taker; (b) investment business; (c) fund services business; (d) trust company business; (e) permit or certificate holder under the CIF Law; (f) unregulated fund or nonpublic fund; (g) permit holder under the Insurance Law; (h) lawyer; (i) accountant; (j) other

- 5.3.2 It is important to understand the extent to which a lender makes use of these concessions and information regarding the obliged person, consequently:
- (a) Question ED3 requests the number of customers where reliance has been placed on obliged persons during the data reporting period (please insert '0' if no reliance has been placed);
- (b) Question ED4 requests the country of the obliged person on whom reliance is being placed at the end of the reporting period (responses should be provided on spreadsheet EE-Lenders-Country list , nil responses are not required); and
- (c) Question ED5 requests the number of obliged persons split by the type of business that is carried on, at the end of the reporting period (please insert '0' if no obliged persons are used).

## ED6 Number of obliged persons relied upon, who failed to provide information and evidence on demand and without delay, during the data reporting period

- 5.3.3 Where a lender relies on an obliged person, Article 16(8) of the Money Laundering Order requires that a lender test, in such manner and at such intervals as they consider appropriate:
- (a) whether or not the obliged person has appropriate policies and procedures in place to apply the reliance identification measures;
- (b) keeps the evidence of identity; and
- (c) will provide that evidence without delay if requested to do so.
- 5.3.4 In light of 5.3.3(c), question ED6 requires a lender to report the number of obliged persons that failed to provide information and evidence on demand and without delay.
- 5.3.5 Please do not leave a cell blank, insert '0' if no obliged persons are used or obliged persons did provide information and evidence when requested.

## 5.4 Exemption from applying third party identification requirements (Articles 17B-D of the MLO)

- 5.4.1 In line with Articles 17B-D of the Money Laundering Order, a lender may be an exempt from applying identification requirements in relation to a third party when the customer is:
- (a) regulated and supervised by the JFSC for AML/CFT/CPF purposes;
- (b) a person who carries on equivalent business (refer to Section 1.7 of the AML/CFT/CPF Handbook); or
- (c) a person who is wholly-owned by a person listed above and meets certain conditions.
- 5.4.2 The application of exemptions from identification measures is also always subject to one or more conditions (depending on the particular case). In practice, these provisions have the effect of:
- (a) limiting the number of customers to which exemptions from identification measures can be applied; and
- (b) requiring the basis for applying exemptions from identification measures to be recorded in writing.

Guide to Section II of risk based supervision data: Lenders

## ED7 Number of customers, by country, where CDD exemptions have been applied to third parties for whom those customers act as at the end of the data reporting period

- 5.4.3 Question ED7 requests data on the number of customers where exemptions from identification measures have been applied at the end of the reporting period, analysed by the country in which the customer is regulated and supervised for AML/CFT/CPF purposes.

- (c) has appropriate policies and procedures in place to apply the identification measures;
- (d) obtains information in relation to the third party;
- (e) keeps the  information or evidence of identity in relation to the third party; and
- (f) provides that information or evidence without delay if requested to do so specifically whether the customer may be prevented, by a law, from providing the information or evidence.
- 5.4.5 In light of 5.4.4(d), question ED8 requires a lender to report the number of customers that failed to provide information and evidence on demand and without delay.
- 5.4.6 Please do not leave the cell blank, insert '0' if no exemptions from identification measures are applied or customers did provide information and evidence when requested.
