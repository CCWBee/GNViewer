## 1 General guidance

## 1.1 Scope

- 1.1.1 In 2018 the JFSC collected supervisory risk data for reporting entities for the first time. This exercise was repeated in 2019 and, as advised on 30 October 2019 i , the JFSC is collecting the same data in 2020.
- 1.1.2 This guidance document relates to the Excel workbook in Section II of the 2020 risk based supervision data collection exercise which collects data in respect of Jersey Private Funds ( JPFs ).
- 1.1.3 The JPF is a financial services business pursuant to Schedule 2, Part B, paragraphs 7(1)(h) and (n) of the Proceeds of Crime (Jersey) Law 1999 ( POC ) and is subject to the requirements of the Money Laundering (Jersey) Order 2008 ( MLO ).
- 1.1.4 A JPF, being a relevant person under the MLO:
- (a) is required to have an MLCO and an MLRO;
- (b) should have obtained Customer Due Diligence ( CDD ) on all its investors (its customers), their beneficial owners and controllers, and on any third parties upon whose behalf the investor acts and the beneficial owners and controllers of those third parties.
- 1.1.5 The JFSC is required to supervise the JPF's compliance with AML/CFT requirements under the Proceeds of Crime (Supervisory Bodies) (Jersey) Law 2008 ( SBL ).

## 1.2 Data collected

- 1.2.1 Funds remain largely excluded from the Section I data collection exercise, however, as the JFSC is required to supervise JPFs the JFSC requires data so that it can continue to risk profile the JPFs and their designated service providers.
- 1.2.2 Consequently, data is again being requested on the customers (investors) of the JPFs. The data is being collected from the JPF's designated service provider.

## 1.3 Excel workbook

- 1.3.1 The Excel workbook that the designated service provider needs to complete in relation to each of the JPFs that it acts for (using one line for each JPF) comprises 11 spreadsheets, as follows:
- (a) ZC1: Fund Compliance Data
- (b) ZC2: Asset Compliance Data
- (c) ZC3: Investor Data
- (d) ZC4: Beneficial Owner, Controller and Third Party Data
- (e) ZC5: Fund Concessions Data
- (f) Countries for specific questions
- › ZC3(a) Countries of Investors
- › ZC3(f) Countries of PEPs
- › ZC4(a) Countries of Beneficial Owners and Controllers of Investors
- › ZC4(b) Countries of Third Parties on whose behalf the investor acts.

Guide to Section II of risk based supervision data: Jersey Private Funds

- (g) ZC6: Freetext Explanations
- (h) List of Questions
- 1.3.2 The JFSC recognises that printing each spreadsheet to determine the data requirements is not possible due to the construct of the document, therefore the last spreadsheet in the Excel workbook contains a list of the questions for printing.

## 1.4 Jersey Private Fund customers of the designated service provider

- 1.4.1 The JFSC is building a body of data in relation to JPFs through the designated service provider. This is the JFSC's principal JPF connection, and is a position required by the JPF Guide (as defined at 1.8).
- 1.4.2 The JFSC expects the designated service provider providing services to the JPF to have conducted a customer risk assessment on the JPF. It is noted that the designated service provider must assume responsibility for 'ensuring compliance with all necessary Jersey AML/CFT requirements applicable to the JPF' ii  and has to give a declaration to this effect. The JFSC would expect the designated service provider, as a minimum, to be able to complete sections ZC1 and ZC2.
- 1.4.3 Where the designated service provider:
- (a) provides the MLCO of the JPF; and/or
- (b) is delegated the responsibility to collate CDD on the JPF's investors,
- the JFSC would expect the designated service provider to be able to complete the whole of the JPF workbook.
- 1.4.4 If another Jersey financial services business provides the services listed in 1.4.3 then please contact the JFSC by no later than 30 January 2020 providing alternative contact details for this financial services business. Each JPF has only been listed once in the workbook of a designated service provider therefore, unless the JFSC is told that there is another Jersey financial services business who should be providing the information requested, then the designated service provider who has the JPF named in its workbook will need to provide the information.
- 1.4.5 If there is no other Jersey financial services business (or no alternative contact is provided by 30 January 2020) then the JFSC requests the designated service provider to liaise with each of the JPFs it acts for to provide the information in the JPF workbook. In the event that the designated service provider is not able to provide any part of the data requested in relation to the JPF then an explanation will need to be provided to the JFSC.
- 1.4.6 The data collected through responses to ZC3 to ZC5 relates to the customers of the JPF i.e. its investors and their beneficial owners and controllers and third parties for whom the investors in the JPF act.

## 1.5 Data reporting period

- 1.5.1 The Section II data reporting period is 1/1/2019 to 31/12/2019.
- 1.5.2 Generally, the data should be provided as at the end of the reporting period (31/12/2019 or closest business day) unless otherwise specified.

## 1.6 Data submission

- 1.6.1 Whilst the JFSC will be collecting the same data as it did in 2019, designated service providers are still recommended to consider the data request as soon as possible. It

may take some time to gather the data requested and the deadline for submission is 17:00 on 31 March 2020 .

- 1.6.2 Each designated service provider will receive an email sent to their JFSC Portal contact indicating that there are documents available for download through the JFSC portal.
- 1.6.3 The JFSC Portal contact will be able to download the JPF Excel workbook which will be populated with the names of the JPFs that the JFSC's records show the designated service provider provides services to.
- 1.6.4 Once the JPF Excel workbook has been downloaded it can be forwarded to the relevant persons within the designated service provider for completion. However, please note that only one consolidated completed JPF Excel workbook per designated service provider should be submitted through the JFSC Portal by the JFSC Portal contact.
- 1.6.5 Notwithstanding who has responsibility for submitting the data, the governing body of the designated service provider and the governing body of the JPF should have oversight of the content of the submission made on their behalf.
- 1.6.6 With the exception of spreadsheet ZC6- Freetext Explanations , all parts of each question should be answered. Consequently, where there is a nil return, insert a '0' where relevant, in each row.
- 1.6.7 Where responses to any questions require further explanation please provide this on the spreadsheet ZC6- Freetext Explanations .
- 1.6.8 No answers are expected for JPFs that are in liquidation, liquidated, terminating or terminated or where the designated service provider has ceased to act (subject to 1.4.4 and 1.4.5 above). Please use ZC6: Freetext Explanations - identifying the JPF and providing an explanation of why no answers are being provided i.e. terminated/liquidated/ceased to act.

## 1.7 Integrity checking your submission

- 1.7.1 For each JPF, the following should add to the same total number, as the questions analyse the total number of investors:
- (a) Type of investors: sum of ZC3(b)(i) to (iii)
- (b) By risk category: sum of ZC3(c)(i)(i) to (iii)

| ZC1(d)                           | Does the JPF accept cash (coins and notes)?

This does not include bank transfers, cheques or any  form of virtual currency transactions. Whilst we recognise that the use of cash is minimal in the Jersey-based funds  sector, it is important that this assumption is validated as cash transactions  are a key risk indicator for money laundering and the financing of terrorism. |

| ZC2(c)                            | Please indicate in which countries the JPF holds assets amounting to  10% or more of its Net Asset Value as at year end (31 December  2019). Select up to 10 countries from the drop down menu .  Use the drop down menu to select up to 10 countries where 10% or more of  the JPF's assets are held. If the JPF has many investments in different  jurisdictions then it may not have as much as 10% in any one jurisdiction, so  will have to leave this question blank. Some JPFs may only provide  information on 2 or 3 countries because their holdings in other countries are  less than 10%. If a JPF has a holding of more than 10% e.g. 50% don't put the  same country five times, just put it once.  This a simple measure, based on analysis, please choose the most appropriate |

Question  ZC3(c)(i)  requests data about the number of investors that have been  assessed as presenting a higher, standard or lower ML/TF risk (on the basis of  factors set out in sections 3.3.4 and 14.2.3 of the AML/CFT Handbook).  Where use is made of a more precise risk scoring scale, it will be necessary to  determine which categories in that scale approximate to higher iv , standard or  lower risk. For example, if a JPF measures risk on a score of 1 to 10, it may  consider anything between 1 and 3 to present a lower risk, 4 to 7 to present a  standard risk, and 8 to 10 to present a higher risk.  If a JPF includes other factors in its customer risk rating of its investors e.g.  commercial risk, and the ML/TF risk element cannot be reported separately,  please report the combined risk rating. |

## Question Number

## Guidance on Question

## Section ZC3-Investor Data

## ZC3(e)

Number of investors and their beneficial owners and controllers where enhanced CDD measures have been applied.

The question is designed to get a general feel for the extent to which enhanced CDD is obtained in relation to investors.

This question requires the total number of investors and their beneficial owners and controllers who have had enhanced due diligence applied to them during 2019, either for any of the specific reasons listed in Section 7 of the AML/CFT Handbook or as a result of the application of an entity CDD policy.

In addition to a JPF deciding that an investor presents a higher risk of money laundering or financing terrorism, there are some circumstances, set out in Articles 15 and 15A of the Money Laundering Order, where enhanced CDD measures are required. See also section 7 of the AML/CFT Handbook which details scenarios where enhanced CDD must be applied .

The following scenarios are considered most relevant for a JPF:

- a) the investor is, or some other prescribed person is, a politically exposed person ( PEP ) (section 7.6)
- b) the investor has a 'relevant connection' to an 'enhanced risk state' (section 7.5)
- c) the investor is a company with nominee shareholders or issues bearer shares (section 7.10)
- d) the investor is a personal asset holding vehicle (section 7.9)
- e) the investor, or one or more beneficial owners/controllers of the investor, is not physically present for identification purpose (section 7.4) or
- f) the investor is a non-Jersey resident (section 7.7)

For example every individual investor in a JPF who is not a Jersey resident individual will need to have enhanced CDD applied to them , as they will fall within section 7.7.

Where the investor is not an individual but for example a company or a limited partnership, then not only the jurisdiction of the company/limited partnership will need to be considered, but so will its beneficial owners and controllers.

For example: if you have a Jersey company which is controlled by its board of 3 directors, 2 are Jersey resident and 1 is UK resident, then enhanced CDD will be applied to that 1 UK resident director, so the Jersey company/limited partnership will need to be reported as 1 investor who has had enhanced CDD applied.

Questions ZC3(f) to ZC3(h) request data on 3 particular reasons for enhanced CDD being applied.

## Question Number

## Guidance on Question

## Section ZC3-Investor Data

## ZC3(f)

Total number and jurisdiction of PEPs who are, or are connected with investors (including via beneficial owners and controllers).

## Answer this question on Country Tab ZC3(f)

Each of the JPFs are listed vertically in column A and there is a choice of countries listed horizontally. Input the number of PEPs in each country per JPF. If there are none leave the entry as '0'.

This question requires the number of investors to which enhanced CDD measures have been applied due to a PEP connection.

On 12 June 2019 the Money Laundering Order was amended (see Article 15A(3) of the Money Laundering Order and Section 7.6.1 of the AML/CFT Handbook). From this date enhanced CDD measures became mandatory for the following:

- a) a domestic politically exposed person only where a high-risk business relationship or high-risk one-off transaction is involved ( domestic PEP );
- b) a foreign politically exposed person ( foreign PEP );
- c) a prominent person;
- d) individuals falling within (a), (b) or (c) that are:
- › beneficial owners or controllers of an investor;
- › a third party for whom the investor acts AND the third parties beneficial owners or controllers ;
- › purporting to act on behalf of the investor.

When considering whether an investor is connected with a domestic PEP or foreign PEP it must be remembered that the definition of a PEP includes close associates and immediate family members of any individual. Close associate and immediate family member are both defined Article 15A(3) of the Money Laundering Order.

The information to be considered when deciding if an investor is a close associate of a domestic PEP or foreign PEP is limited to information in the possession of the JPF or information that is publicly known (Article 15A(4) of the Money Laundering Order).

PEPs should be reported under the country (or countries) which give rise to their PEP status. For example, in a case where an individual is entrusted with a public function in country A and the close family member of that foreign PEP resides in country B, both PEPs should be reported under country A.

Transaction monitoring may arise in an administrative context such as spot checks by compliance (scheduled or triggered by transactions) or as part of a transaction where checks are undertaken as to whether a transaction matches a profile of expected activity.

Trigger events - such as payments in and distributions to the investor, change of address, change of bank account, deviation from investor profile and expected transactions etc.

Scheduled review - a periodic review based on the risk rating of the investor, with higher risk investor scheduled reviews taking place more frequently than lower risk investors.

Electronic screening - for PEPS, Sanctions and/or intelligence such as judgements or news alerts.

Other/All of the above - Please use Other in the event that additional types of monitoring are undertaken and explain what is done in ZC6 . Also choose Other if not All of the above is done but more than one. Please explain in ZC6 what is done.

In the event that investor relationships are not monitored please choose Other and explain why investor relationships are not monitored in ZC6.

Answer this question on Country Tab ZC4(b) Each of the JPFs are listed vertically in column A and there is a choice of  countries listed horizontally. Input the number of third parties for whom  investors are acting for by principal country of residence per JPF. If there are  none leave the entry as '0'. For example, a legal arrangement cannot form a business relationship or carry  out a one-off transaction itself. It is the trustee(s) of the trust or general  partner(s) of the limited partnership who will enter into a business  relationship or carry out the one-off transaction with a JPF on behalf of the  legal arrangement and who will be considered to be the investor(s). In line  with Article 3 of the Money Laundering Order, the trust or limited partnership  will be considered to be the third party on whose behalf the trustee(s) or  general partner(s) act(s).  In these cases the JPF should have identified the persons for whom the  investor is acting in line with Article 3(2) of the Money Laundering Order and  the guidance provided in section 4 of the AML/CFT Handbook. For ease  guidance has been provided below: a) In a case where the third party is a legal person (e.g. a company),  data should be provided on the individuals who are beneficial  owner or controller of that legal person (Article 3(2)(b)(ii) of the  Money Laundering Order).  b) In a case where a third party is a trust (other than a collective  investment fund), data should be provided on:  › the settlor vi ;  › the protector;  › beneficiaries with a vested right;  › other beneficiaries and persons who are the object of a  power that have been identified as presenting a higher risk;  and  › any other person who exercises ultimate effective control  over the trust (Article 3(7) of the Money Laundering Order).  c) In a case where a third party is a limited partnership (other than a |

Consequently, this question is designed to elicit the total number of  concessions applied to investors by the JPF. It is acknowledged that more than  one concession may be utilised for the same investor. The response to this question should equal the sum of ZC5(c)(i) to (ix).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ZC5(b)                       | Number of investors where delayed verification in line with  Article 13(4) of the MLO was applied In accordance with Article 13(4) of the Money Laundering Order a JPF is  permitted to delay verifying the identity of an investor where (finding out the  identity of the investor must not be delayed): a) it is necessary not to interrupt the normal course of business;  b) there is little risk of money laundering or financing of terrorism  occurring as a result of obtaining evidence of identity after  establishing the relationship; and  c) evidence of identity is obtained as soon as reasonably  practicable. Question  ZC5(b)  collects data about the number of investors where delayed  verification in line with Article 13(4) of the Money Laundering Order has been  applied.  If a JPF has not delayed the verification of any investors identity during the  data reporting period, please respond with '0'. |

| Reliance                                                          | Articles 16 and 16A   |

| Exemptions from applying third party  identification requirements | Articles 17B-D        |
| Other CDD exemptions                                              | Article 18            |

This question is designed to analyse the number of types of concessions applied to investors, their beneficial owners and controllers and third parties for whom the investor acts during the CDD process.

## Reliance - Article 16

In line with Article 16 of the Money Laundering Order, reliance may be placed on an obliged person only where the six conditions, explained in section 5.1 of the AML/CFT Handbook, are met. In practice, this has the effect of:

- a) limiting the number of obliged persons that can be relied upon; and
- b) requiring the basis for placing reliance to be recorded in writing.

In line with Article 16A of the Money Laundering Order, reliance may be placed on an obliged person that is part of the same financial group only where the six conditions, explained in section 5.2 of the AML/CFT Handbook, are met. The effect of this is similar to Article 16.

This question is not seeking the number of entities upon which reliance is placed it is seeking the number of investors where reliance has been used in the CDD process. This might be where reliance is used in relation to the investor or any beneficial owners or controllers of the investor. For example, if reliance is used in relation to both the investor and its 4 beneficial owners and controllers, then this would count as 1 investor.

## Exemptions from applying third party identification requirements Articles 17B-D

In line with Articles 17B-D of the Money Laundering Order, a JPF may apply CDD exemptions and not find out the identity of a third party on whose behalf a customer acts or obtain evidence of identity. The application of the exemptions is dependent upon the status of the customer and in some circumstances the JPF.

The JPF may apply exemption from applying third party identification requirements in 4 circumstances if the fund has reasonable grounds for believing that its investor is:

- a) regulated and supervised by the JFSC for AML/CFT purposes;
