## 1 '8.1 Asset Quality &amp; Provisions'

## Summary of specific and general provisions and of loan quality

- 1.1 This sheet is intended to provide an overview of the Branch's provisions and the underlying credit quality of its loans and advances.
- 1.2 The quality of loans and advances must be segmented by the Branch to provide:
- 1.2.1 An analysis of non-performing loans according to number of days past due; and
- 1.2.2 A segmentation based on the Branch's own classification of its loans and advances.
- 1.3 It is expected that the total amount of loans classified as 'substandard' or 'default' will be consistent with the figure reported for 'Gross loans provided against' and that both figures will be correlated with those for past due loans, particularly those relating to loans classified as more than 90 days past due. Where figures appear to be materially inconsistent, an explanation should be provided in the covering letter.

## 4 '8.4 Lending by Sector'

## Lending by sector and type

- 4.1 The sector analysis report requires a breakdown between the columns 'Local' and 'Non Local'. If residence is uncertain, all customers that provide a Jersey address should be classed as 'Local' unless either:
- 4.1.1 The address is that of a Jersey financial intermediary and the beneficial owner's residence is unknown; or
- 4.1.2 The customer is not believed to be resident in Jersey,
- in which case treat as 'Non Local'.
- 4.2 Items A.1 to A.10.3 should be completed with a breakdown of the OIB's loans and advances by sector.

- 4.3 Items B.1 and B.2 should be completed with an analysis of the OIB's loans and advances allocated between 'Overdrafts' and all 'Other Loans &amp; Advances'.
- 4.4 Items A.0 and B.0 are the respective sums from the data entered above. As such they should total the same amount, and each should equate to the total reported in sheet '2.1 BS Assets' for Item 'D.0: Loans and Advances Total'.
- 4.5 Item A.0.1 is calculated as the difference between items A.0 and B.0 and should equal "Nil".

## 5 '8.5 Large Exposures'

## Introduction

- 5.1 All Branches are required to provide a statement of the 10 largest credit exposures in excess of £10 million that fall within the guidelines provided below.
- 5.2 Exposures include off balance sheet items and placements, as defined within Appendix II to the Code, 'Large Exposures: definitions'. Reporters should be familiar with this part of the Code. In particular, it is necessary to determine whether individual borrowers are connected or associated in any way so as to ensure appropriate aggregation.
- 5.3 Some exposures should instead be reported within the 'Exempt Large Exposures' sheet (see Section 6).  These are:
- 5.3.1 Direct exposures to a central government or central bank that is rated BBB- or higher;
- 5.3.2 Placements to head office and other branches of the parent;
- 5.3.3 Placements to banks within the same group as the reporting branch; and
- 5.3.4 Placements to third party banks that are rated BBB- or higher.
- 5.4 The rating used for this purpose must be a rating provided by one of either Fitch, Moody's or Standard and Poor's. Where an exposure is rated by more than one of these agencies:
- 5.4.1 For an exposure rated by three agencies: rank the three ratings and select the middle rating; and
- 5.4.2 For an exposure rated by two agencies: The lower of the two ratings must be selected.
- 5.5 'Placements' include loans and certificates of deposits and similar short term debt. It does not extend to other exposures such as holdings of bank FRNs, which should be reported on this sheet.
- 5.6 Exposures to group non-banking entities, should be aggregated and reported here (if all other criteria are met - top 10 and in excess of £10 million) - and indicated by entering 'Y' in the 'Connected?' column.
