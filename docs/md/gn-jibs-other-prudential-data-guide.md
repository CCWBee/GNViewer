## 3 '9.3 Additional Detail'

- 3.1 Report items where further detail is required.  These may include items specified by the JFSC from time to time or in any Prudential Reporting Guide, in which case the format will be specified. Otherwise, please follow the below guidance.

## Fields denoted as 'Detail'

- 3.2 Where fields are denoted as 'Detail' in any sheet, identify here any component that exceeds 5% of the total for the item in question.
- 3.3 Enter the relevant figures for this quarter and the preceding quarter.
- 3.4 In the case of Item A.9 'Detail' on sheet '8.3 Total Deposits', report the total deposits for any relevant country only (i.e. no currency breakdown), where this exceeds 5% of the amount reported for that Item.

## 4 '9.4 Commentary on Movements'

## Material Movements

- 4.1 Report material movements in accordance with the below.
- 4.2 Material changes to the bank's balance sheet : in the description give a brief summary of the change, report the amount for the current and previous quarter. As a guide to materiality, a movement in an item that exceeds 10% compared to the previous balance and where the item constitutes over 5% of the balance sheet footings should always be considered to be material.
- 4.3 Material changes to the bank's regulatory capital; as reported in the Core Module : in the description give a brief summary of the change, report the amount for the current and previous quarter. As a guide to materiality, a movement in an item that exceeds 10% compared to the previous balance and where the item constitutes over 5% of capital should always be considered to be material.
- 4.4 Other material changes in items reported in all modules in the prudential return : in the description give a brief summary of the change, report the amount for the current and previous quarter. As a guide to materiality, a movement in an item that exceeds 10% compared to the previous balance and where the item constitutes over 5% of capital should always be considered to be material.
- 4.5 In all cases, a commentary should be submitted with the return explaining material movements that reference this sheet. It is accepted that there is a degree of subjectivity in respect of materiality.
- 4.6 The above extends to all parts of the prudential return. A shorter explanation may be appropriate where full details have already been communicated to the JFSC but, otherwise, the commentary should be along similar lines to any other communication with the JFSC regarding a significant development.

## 5 '9.5 DCS Data'

- 5.1 Further to the work carried out in 2011, the Jersey Bank Depositors Compensation Board ('DCS Board') has requested that the JFSC collect, and provide to it, updated data in respect of eligible depositors. Data must be provided annually, in the December return. However, banks that have put in place a robust automated process for the collection of this data are asked to provide this data in every quarterly return.
- 5.2 The DCS Board has accepted that a best endeavours basis may be appropriate and it is therefore accepted that simplifying assumptions may be made provided that they are described within the covering letter submitted with the prudential return and that plans are put in place, and described within the covering letter, to address the underlying issues.
- 5.3 Four items of data are required (one line for each):
- 5.3.1 A: Total number of eligible depositors;
- 5.3.2 B: Total eligible deposits held (i.e. total of all deposits held by eligible depositors);
- 5.3.3 C: Total eligible deposits held up to £50,000 per depositor (i.e. the total potential liability of the DCS); and
- 5.3.4 D: Total eligible deposits held up to £5,000 per depositor (i.e. the total potential liability of the DCS to pay interim compensation).
- 5.4 JIBs that are able to provide quarterly data should report the current and prior quarter values. If only Annual data is available, please report only the Current value.

## 6 '9.6 FIRB Detail'

- 6.1 Only relevant for JIBs having permission to use FIRB approach models for credit risk
- 6.2 For each Portfolio to which a model applies, report:
- 6.2.1 The Portfolio Name;
- 6.2.2 The Amount, being the total of all exposures;
- 6.2.3 The risk weight assets ( RWA ), under the model; and
- 6.2.4 The RWA under the JFSC's Standard Approach to Credit Risk.
- 6.3 JIBs must use consistent mappings from quarter to quarter for the mapping of internal models to Portfolio numbers unless a change is agreed with the JFSC.
- 6.4 In the event that a JIB uses more models than there are Portfolios available in the sheet (i.e. more than 26), the mapping of models to portfolios should be agreed with the JFSC.

## 7 '9.7 AIRB Detail'

- 7.1 Only relevant for JIBs having permission to use AIRB approach models for credit risk
- 7.2 For each Portfolio to which a model applies, report:
- 7.2.1 The Portfolio Name;
- 7.2.2 The Amount, being the total of all exposures;
- 7.2.3 The risk weight assets ( RWA ), under the model; and
- 7.2.4 The RWA under the JFSC's Standard Approach to Credit Risk.
- 7.3 JIBs must use consistent mappings from quarter to quarter for the mapping of internal models to Portfolio numbers unless a change is agreed with the JFSC.
- 7.4 In the event that a JIB uses more models than there are Portfolios available in the sheet (i.e. more than 26), the mapping of models to portfolios should be agreed with the JFSC.

## 8 '9.8 Local Interbank Market'

## Schedule of amounts placed with and received from Jersey banks

- 8.1 Where the gross balance (deposits placed plus received) for any required currency, or aggregate of currencies, is less than £1 million, the registered person may choose not to report an amount for that currency or aggregate.
- 8.2 A counterparty breakdown may be requested by the JFSC. This will typically take the form of a request for information on significant counterparties and the currency of exposures. If such a request is made, the information should be reported in the rows below the summary data information (rows 1 to 100). Otherwise, these rows should be left blank.
- 8.3 Report gross balances in the columns headed 'Placed with' and 'Received from', showing the gross amounts placed with and received from Jersey registered deposit takers.  This includes amounts placed with overseas branches of JIBs but, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include amounts placed with overseas branches of banks that operate in Jersey through a branch.
- 8.4 This may include amounts already disclosed in the 'Large Exposures' and 'Exempt Large Exposures' sheets and those disclosed in the Liquidity Module as falling within the top 10 bank depositors. Please aggregate amounts by currency in accordance with the following:

|   Row | Currency   | Balances to be reported                                  |
|-------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

|   106 | OTH        | The aggregate of all other currency balances             |
|   107 | TOTAL      | Calculated by the sheet as the total of rows 101 to 106. |
