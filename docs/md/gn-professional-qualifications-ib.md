## 1 Guidance

- 1.1 Section 3.3 of the Code of Practice for Investment Business (the IB Code) requires a registered person to assess and monitor the competence of its employees.  Paragraph 3.3.5 of the IB Code details the competency requirements for a registered person's employee's method by which competence can be assessed is by reference to professional qualifications that an employee may hold.  Paragraph 3.3.5.1 of the IB Code states that all investment employees must have obtained a professional qualification appropriate to their role.
- 1.2 The Review of Financial Advice (RFA), a key part of the Commission's consumer protection strategy, identified a need to raise the professional standards of investment employees. Accordingly, the IB Code require that, from 1 January 2014, any investment employee providing investment advice to Retail Clients (as defined in the IB Code) must hold an appropriate professional qualification at Qualifications and Credit Framework level 4 or above, or level 3 with gap-fill where relevant, as described in paragraph 3.3.6 of the IB Code.
- 1.3 This Guidance Note contains, within section 2 below, details of professional qualifications that are acceptable to the Commission when held by investment employees who perform various regulated functions within investment businesses.  This Guidance Note should be read in conjunction with the IB Code.
- 1.4 The IB Code state that a registered person is responsible for ensuring that its employees are appropriately qualified for the role (or roles) that they perform.  Registered persons should be aware that a qualification that is suitable, for example, for an employee that provides investment advice to professional clients may not be acceptable for a different activity, such as managing investments or providing investment advice to Retail Clients.
- 1.5 The Commission is aware of the availability of many accredited investment related professional qualifications.  Qualifications that are not listed within this Guidance Note (for example, qualifications provided by overseas awarding bodies or others included in the Appropriate Qualification Tables  of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA)) may be accepted by the Commission as equivalent to those referenced in the table below.  When considering the FCA Appropriate Qualification Table, reference is necessary to the FCA list of Appropriate Qualification Activities.
- 1.6 Paragraph 3.3.9 of the IB Code details the process by which an application may be made to the Commission for alternative qualifications to receive consideration.
- 1.7 Where paragraph 3.3.8 of the IB Code is relevant (complex transactions are undertaken or complex investments are advised upon, for example derivatives), a registered person may wish to refer to the list of the FCA's list of Appropriate Qualifications Activities and Appropriate Qualification Tables to consider whether the qualification of an investment employee is compatible with a particular investment activity.
- 1.8 The table of qualifications contained in section 2 of this Guidance Note will be reviewed and updated periodically to take into account changes to qualifications, including the addition of new relevant qualifications, and comments received from the investment business industry.
- 1.9 Please note that some qualifications may only be considered appropriate for 'Advising Retail Clients' when combined with qualification gap-fill. Gap-fill constitutes additional structured continuing professional development, which need not involve examination, completed by an

investment employee, and verified by an accredited body as approved by the FCA. Consequently, the table of qualifications includes two columns relating to 'Advising Retail Clients' to highlight those qualifications where gap-fill is relevant.
