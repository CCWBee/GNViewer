The new Registry Law

The Financial Services (Disclosure and Provision of Information) (Jersey) Law 2020

## 1 Introduction

- 1.1 If you are a Jersey resident and thinking about setting up a limited company in Jersey, the sections below will take you through the process of incorporation, explain the forms that you will need to complete, and how to submit them with the Registry.
- 1.2 If you are not already trading, you should be aware that as part of the process you must obtain a Business Licence from the Population Office which enables you to trade legally. Licences are ordinarily only granted to those who have residential and employment statuses of entitled, entitled for work or licensed. The Registry does not deal with Business Licences so you need to contact the Population Office (Business Licensing) directly about this businesslicensing@gov.je.

Note: On 1 December 2020, the Financial Services (Disclosure and Provision of Information) (Jersey) Law 2020 (the 'new Registry Law')  will come into force which will implement changes as to the way in which incorporations and changes to beneficial ownership and control are registered, amongst other things. This guidance will be updated in line with the introduction of the new Registry Law to reflect these.

## 2 What is a limited company?

- 2.1 A limited company has owners who are legally responsible for its debts only to the extent of the amount of capital they invested. The liability of members or subscribers of a limited company is limited to what they have invested or guaranteed to the company. Limited companies may be limited by shares or by guarantee.

## Share capital, liability and structure

- 2.2 The Companies Law permits the incorporation of companies with different share structures and liability. Most companies incorporated in Jersey are private limited companies with par value shares but a private limited company can also be established with no par value shares.
- 2.3 It is also possible to incorporate public limited companies, unlimited companies, companies limited by guarantee and cell companies in Jersey.
- Note: The Registry cannot give advice about share capital, liability and structure of your company. You must seek independent advice on this before you submit your incorporation documents to the Registry.

## Par value companies

- 2.4 A par value company can issue shares that have a nominal value. Par value shares can be issued at 'par' or at any level of premium.  The number of shares of each class which a par value company is authorised to issue is stated in the memorandum of association.

## No par value companies

- 2.5 A no par value company issues shares which are not expressed as having a par value or nominal value. The number of shares of each class which a no par value company is authorised to issue is stated in the memorandum of association.

## Public companies

- 2.6 Public companies have different formalities to private companies under the Companies Law. There are a significant number of public limited liability companies incorporated in Jersey (with both par value and no par value shares), including many that are listed on the UK, US and other stock exchanges / regulated markets.

## Unlimited companies

- 2.7 An unlimited company is one which has shares in issue and no guarantee members. The liability of the holder of the shares is unlimited upon winding up of the company.

## Guarantee companies

- 2.8 A guarantee company is one which has only guarantee members. The members' liability is limited to the amounts they guarantee.

## Directors

- 2.9 Under the Companies Law, Jersey private companies must have at least one director. A Jersey private company does not need to have directors upon incorporation but cannot function until directors are appointed. The directors must be appointed by the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association. A register of directors must be maintained at the registered office which is open to inspection by the shareholders and the Registrar but, in the case of private companies, such information does not need to be public.
- 2.10 Jersey companies are permitted to have corporate directors provided that the body corporate acting as a director is registered to provide such services pursuant to the Financial Services (Jersey) Law 1998 and does not itself have any directors who are bodies corporate. The body corporate does not need to be a Jersey Company.
- 2.11 Directors may participate in meetings by electronic means, such as via telephone or video conferencing.

## Secretary

- 2.12 A secretary must be appointed by the board of directors. A sole director may not act as secretary, and no company may have as secretary a body corporate whose sole director is sole director of the company. The secretary's duties are principally the keeping of minutes of directors' and shareholders' meetings, maintenance of the register of shareholders, recording transfers and the new issues of shares, maintenance of the register of directors and ensuring that the statutory requirements such as filing of the annual return (covered below under Section 3.10) are fulfilled

- 3.12 If you already have the same registered business name (RBN) which will be associated with the company you wish to incorporate then explain this in the ' significance of name ' section. (If this isn ' t the case, insert 'N/A' in the box).
- 3.13 Continue through the application process, click ' validate document ' and ' continue ' .

This does not mean that your name has been reserved and you will need to wait until we have sent you a further email stating that your name has been accepted before you can incorporate your company. You will usually receive an email

stating your chosen name has been accepted or rejected within 24 hours of the submission (Monday to Friday).

The name of a private Jersey company should end with 'Limited', 'Ltd', 'avec responsabilité limitée' or 'a.r.l.'. A company which uses any of the above may, in setting out or using its name for any purpose under the Companies Law, do so in full or in the abbreviated form.
- 3.15.4 If a name is regarded as similar to an existing company, the name will be rejected and details will be required by the Registrar as to the reason for the similarity and the existing company's permission for using the name may need to be obtained.

## Form C2b

- 3.22 Where the proposed ultimate beneficial ownership is held by many individuals and no individual by himself or collectively with any associates will control more than 10% of the shares), the Registrar may be willing to relax the disclosure requirements. If it is expected that further beneficial owners will be introduced within six months of the date of incorporation, details of the proposed arrangements need to be provided to the Registrar by filing a BOC17 form.
